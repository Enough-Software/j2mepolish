	<h2 id="whycommercial">Why do I need a commercial license?</h2>
	<p>When you develop applications with J2ME Polish, specific APIs are woven into
	your application during the build process, i.e. the GUI classes, the serialization classes, the game-engine classes, 
	the localization classes, the logging classes, etc. Since your application then uses these classes
	you effectively link agains the J2ME Polish library. The GNU GPL license requires you to
	publish your completely source code solely under the GNU GPL again. That's why the alternative
	commercial licenses exist. These commercial licenses allow you to use J2ME Polish
	completely without any restrictions for your commercial applications.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="singleapplication">So what constitutes a 'single application'?</h2>
	<p>
	If you want to license J2ME Polish for one or several single applications, you need to obtain one Single License for each
	application or obtain alternatively the Enterprise License.<br />
	We define a 'single application' like a layman would do - so as long as a normal person would still regard this application as
	being the same. A single application can include for example:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Several versions</li>
		<li>Different device ports</li>
		<li>Design customizations</li>
		<li>Localizations</li>
		<li>Small functionality changes like a customized user navigation, different about screens, and similar</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	As sooon as the main objective or the core feature set of an application changes, it will not constitute a 'single application'
	in our licensing terms - so please obtain an additional license for this scenario. Also different branches like a 'basic' and
	an 'enterprise' version of your application usually requires separated licensing. 
	If in doubt please ask us on <i>j2mepolish(at)enough(dot)de</i>.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="gplsufficient">In what cases do I NOT need a commercial license?</h2>
	<p>You can use J2ME Polish commercially for closed source application as well, but you must not
	use any of the following advanced features in that case:
	</p>
	<ul>
	 <li>The J2ME Polish GUI</li>
	 <li>The Serialization Framework</li>
	 <li>The Remote Method Invocation (RMI) Framework</li>
	 <li>The Persistence Framework</li>
	 <li>The Game Engine / MIDP/2.0 compatible game-API</li>
	 <li>The Logging Framework</li>
	 <li>The Localization Framework</li>
	 <li>The BitMapFont classes</li>
	 <li>Any utility classes</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When you use any of the above features you need to use the commercial license of J2ME Polish.
	</p>
	<p>You can use the building framework along with the device database, the preprocessing, the 
	resource assembling and so on for building commercial J2ME applications 
	without acquiring a commercial license.
	</p>
	<p>
	You can also extend J2ME Polish by using the extension points (that are all based on
	the de.enough.polish.Extension class) without needing to release your extension under the GPL.
	The same applies for your own backgrounds and borders that are based on J2ME Polish.
	So you can create and sell commercial extensions for J2ME Polish without needing to license J2ME Polish yourself.
	</p>
	<p>
	The device database itself is also licensed under the GPL, so if you want to use the database for
	something different than building your applications, you need our written consent first (or publish your
	project under the GPL again).
