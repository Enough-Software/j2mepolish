	<h2 id="improvements111">Improvements of J2ME Polish 1.1.1</h2>
	<p>
	J2ME Polish 1.1.1 contains several bugfixes and improvements compared to the last release:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Logging Framework</b>: 
	  The preprocessing symbols &quot;polish.debug.debug&quot;, &quot;polish.debug.info&quot;, &quot;polish.debug.warn&quot;,
	  &quot;polish.debug.error&quot; and &quot;polish.debug.fatal&quot; can now be used additionally to
	  the usual #debug directive.
	   <hr/>
	  </li>
	  <li><b>GUI Improvements</b>: 
	   The &quot;icon-image&quot; attribute is now evaluated even when
	   an image has been loaded already. In this way a screen can have different
	   icons for focused elements, for example.
	   <hr/>
	   The loading of the additional style attributes now is significant faster and
	   less heap intensive.
	   <hr/>
	  </li>
	  <li><b>Game-Engine Improvements</b>: 
	   MIDP/1.0 devices which do not support Sprite-transformations are now in the 
	   &quot;NoSpriteTransformations&quot;-group, so resources for such
	   devices can be placed in the &quot;resources/NoSpriteTransformations&quot; folder.
	   <hr/>
	   Whether a MIDP/1.0 device supports sprite transformations can now be checked with
	   the &quot;polish.supportSpriteTransformation&quot;-symbol:
	   <br/>
<pre>
//#if polish.midp2 || polish.supportSpriteTransformation
	this.sprite.setTransform( Sprite.TRANS_MIRROR );
//#else
	this.sprite.setFrameSequence( MIRROR_SEQUENCE );
//#endif
</pre>
	   <hr/>
	  </li>
	  <li><b>Resolved Bugs of the GUI</b>: In the GUI several minor bugs have been fixed:
	  	<ul>
		<li>CustomItem: when a custom item was scrolled it could be painted above the title.
		The given rectangle in the traverse()-method was null and not evaluated correctly. 
		</li>
		<li>ChoiceGroup: For a POPUP ChoiceGroup an Item-State-Changed-event was fired 
		unnecessarily, when the popup was opened. 
		The scrolling of the POPUP ChoiceGroup has been improved.
		</li>
		</ul>
	  	
	   <hr/>
	  </li>
	  <li><b>Resolved Bugs of the Game-Engine</b>: 
	  	The collision-rectangles of sprites were calculated incorrectly
		with some transformations.
	   <hr/>
	  </li>
	  <li><b>Thanks</b>: 
	  Thanks goes to Thomas Broyer for improving the Sprite implementation,
	  Kostas Kakoulis for bug-reports and improvement suggestions,
	  Ohad Barzilay for publishing a J2ME Polish-article on mobilegd.com,
	  and everyone who's making suggestions for further improvements!
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="improvements11">Improvements of J2ME Polish 1.1</h2>
	<p>
	J2ME Polish 1.1 contains several bugfixes and improvements compared to the 1.0 release:
	</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Mac OS X Support</b>: 
	OS X is now officially supported by J2ME Polish, which makes it the
	premium choice for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X developers.
	<hr/>
	</li>
	<li><b>MIDlet Signing</b>: 
	The <a href="../docs/how-tos.html#howto-signing">signing of MIDlets</a> is now 
	supported by J2ME Polish.
	<hr/>
	<li><b>New &lt;java&gt; Element</b>: 
	With the new <a href="../docs/build-build.html#java">&lt;java&gt; element</a> 
	J2ME Polish can be extended even more.
	<hr/>
	</li>
	<li><b>Binary Third Party Libraries</b>: you can now include third party
	APIs which are available in binary-only form with the 
	&quot;binaryLibraries&quot; attribute of the &lt;build&gt; element.
	<hr/>
	</li>
	<li><b>GUI and Device Database</b>: PointerEvents are now support by J2ME Polish.
	<hr/>
	Devices can define the &quot;polish.needsManualMenu&quot; symbol when the
	menu-bar should be painted by J2ME Polish, even though no fullscreen mode is
	used. This is required for Sony Ericsson P900 for example.  
	<hr/>
	Devices can now define the &quot;polish.usePolishTitle&quot; variable. When this
	variable is set to true, the title will be painted by J2ME Polish, even when
	the MIDP/2.0 environment is available.
	<hr/>
	The labels of commands can now be changed with defining the variables
	&quot;polish.command.ok&quot;, &quot;polish.command.cancel&quot;, &quot;polish.command.options&quot; and &quot;polish.command.select&quot;.
	<hr/>
	Updated and added device definitions. 
	<hr/>
	</li>
	<li><b>JAD & MANIFEST Attributes</b>: 
	The install-notify, delete-notify and delete-confirm attributes
	are now added by default to both the JAD as well as the MANIFEST.
	<hr/>
	<li><b>build.xml and Integration</b>: 
	The sample build.xml file has been improved, so that no clean
	rebuild is needed when the test mode is enabled or disabled.
	A sample for signing MIDlets has also be included.
	<hr/>
	J2ME Polish now integrates much nicer into new and existing projects,
	since only the &quot;build.xml&quot; file and the &quot;resources&quot;-folder 
	need to be copied into the project.
	<hr/>
	<li><b>Game-Engine</b>: 
	Thomas Broyer improved the GameCanvas implementation in performance
	and memory footprint.
	<hr/>
	</li>
	<li><b>Bugs</b>: 
	J2ME Polish ran into an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when
	several MIDlets were defined. This problem has been resolved.
	<hr/>
	The variable &quot;polish.TiledLayer.TransparentTileColor&quot; was ignored
	by the TiledLayer implementation. It now works as advertised.
	<hr/>
	</li>
	<li><b>Documentation</b>: 
	The documentation now offers <a href="../docs/how-tos.html">How-tos</a>,
	which give some tips and tricks about the usage of J2ME Polish.
	<hr/>
	</li>
	<li><b>Thanks</b>: 
	Thanks for this release goes to Kostas Kakoulis and J&uuml;gen Schlierf for 
	testing pointer events, Thomas Broyer for his optimizations of the
	GameCanvas, Michael Powers for his support on porting J2ME Polish to Mac OS X,
	Mat Williams for bringing the install-notify etc JAD & MANIFEST attributes to attention 
	and for his suggestions of adding support for the nested &lt;java&gt; element,
	Sebastian Szczygiel for improvements of the device database,
	and Thomas Kappen for the bug-report regarding several MIDlets and a casting problem.
	And thanks to all you users of J2ME Polish!
