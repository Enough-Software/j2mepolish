	<p>
	J2ME Polish 1.2.3c just fixes the broken &quot;useDefaultPackage&quot;-option of
	the &lt;obfuscator&gt; element. In case this option makes trouble in your project,
	please make sure that you only use import-statements rather than using classes
	fully qualified.</p>
	<p>This example breaks (don't do it like this):
	<pre>
	public class MyClass extends com.company.package.MyOtherClass {
	</pre></p>
	<p>
	This example works fine (do it like this):	
	<pre>
	import com.company.package.MyOtherClass;
	
	public class MyClass extends MyOtherClass {
	</pre>
	</p>
	<h2 id="improvements123b">Improvements of J2ME Polish 1.2.3b</h2>
	<p>
	J2ME Polish 1.2.3b is a small update with following bugfixes and improvements:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>sample build.xml</b>: 
		The &quot;useDefaultPackage&quot;-attribute of the &lt;obfuscator&gt; element
		was spelled wrong in the sample application of the 1.2.3a release.
		<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Display.setCurrentItem( Item )</b>: 
		When Display.setCurrentItem( Item ) was called when the corresponding
		screen was never shown before, the focused item did not always 
		get the correct CSS-style.
		<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>TextField</b>: 
		The PASSWORD TextField did not work properly when a default
		value had been given and the direct input mode was used.
		<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Motorola/Non-Fullscreen-Mode</b>: 
		When the GUI was used for Motorola devices and the fullscreen
		mode was deactivated, a compile error occurred.
		<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Sony-Ericsson P910/Fullscreen-Mode</b>: 
		The Sony-Ericsson P910 does crash, when Canvas.setFullScreenMode() 
		is called somewhere else than in the paint()-method. This bug
		is now circumvented by the J2ME Polish GUI.
		<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Device Database</b>: 
		The <a href="../devices-overview.html">device database</a> now offers a user friendly view of the most
		important capabilities and known issues.
		<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Thanks</b>: for this release go to
		Philipp Stolze, Salvatore Pellegriti, Milosz Weckowski and Wuyad.
		<hr />
	</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="improvements123a">Improvements of J2ME Polish 1.2.3a</h2>
	<p>
	J2ME Polish 1.2.3a is a small update with following bugfixes and improvements:
	</p>
	<h3 id="bugfixes123a">Bug Fixes</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Automatic Stacktrace Resolving</b>: 
		Under Windows the automatic resolver of stacktraces got stuck when the 
		jad decompiler issued more than 40 lines of errors.
		<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>polish.TextField.useDirectInput</b>: 
		Setting that preprocessing variable resulted in a 
		compile error.
		<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>compilerModePreverify</b>: 
		The preverifying in the compiler-only mode did not work
		correctly.
		<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Form.set()</b>: 
		Form.set() and Form.add() did not trigger a repaint.
	</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="improvements123a">Improvements</h3>
	<ul>
	<!--
	<li><b>Menu Bar</b>: 
		The margins of the menu bar can now be set with the following preprocessing 
		variables: polish.Menu.MarginBottom, polish.Menu.MarginTop, polish.Menu.MarginLeft, 
		polish.Menu.MarginRight - the default value is 2 pixels for each margin 
		but the polish.Menu.MarginBottom (which is 0 by default).
<pre>
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.Menu.MarginBottom&quot; value=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
		<hr />
	</li>
	-->
		<li><b>Obfuscator.useDefaultPackage</b>: 
		J2ME Polish can now move all classes to the default package
		for you. This includes the MIDlet-classes as well and can result
		in a smaller jar-size. Please note that you are responsible for
		preventing name-clashes of classes. You do not need to adjust
		your &lt;midlet&gt; settings, this is done automatically by J2ME Polish.

<pre>
&lt;obfuscator name=&quot;ProGuard&quot; useDefaultPackage=&quot;true&quot; unless=&quot;test&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
		<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>New Borders</b>: 
		you can now use the additional border-types &quot;bottom&quot;, &quot;top&quot;, 
		&quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, which support the same attribute as the &quot;simple&quot; border, 
		for example:

<pre>
focused {
	font-color: red;
	border {
		type: bottom;
		color: red;
		width: 2;
	}
}
</pre>
		<hr />
	</li>
	<!--
	<li><b>Image-Background</b>: 
		The image-background can now be aligned as well, which
		can be useful for gradient backgrounds. You can use the 
		normal layout-terminology, e.g. &quot;left | center&quot;, &quot;h-center | v-center&quot;
		and so on. Default layout is centered.
<pre>
.myStyle {
	font-color: red;
	background {
		type: image;
		image: url( bg.png );
		repeat: repeat-y;
		layout: left;
	}
}
</pre>
		<hr />
	</li>
	-->
	<li><b>Display.setCurrentItem( Item )</b>: 
		Display.setCurrentItem( Item ) is now automatically resolved
		by J2ME Polish and can be used for MIDP/1.0 as well as MIDP/2.0
		phones if you use the J2ME Polish GUI.
		<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>&lt;obfuscator&gt; and &lt;debug&gt;</b>: 
		The &lt;obfuscator&gt;  and &lt;debug&gt; elements do not need
		the &quot;enable&quot; attribute any more - this is now always true and
		is deprecated. Please use the &quot;if&quot; and &quot;unless&quot; attributes in
		case you need to control those elements from now on.
		<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Thanks</b>: for this release go to
		Andrew Emmons, Thomas Kraft, Milosz Weckowski, 
		Philipp Stolze, Eran and Fernando Gomes.
		<hr />
	</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="improvements123">Improvements of J2ME Polish 1.2.3</h2>
	<p>
	J2ME Polish 1.2.3 brings a full screen UI for all MIDP/2.0 phones,
	the ability to automatically resolve stack traces like 
	&quot;RuntimeException at at com.company.MyClass.mymethod(+22)&quot;,
	an editor for binary files like level-data, the ability to
	use different packagers, and
	provides many small but fine improvements, a couple of
	bug fixes and an updated device database as well as documentation:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Bitmap Fonts</b>: 
	Using the font-editor in the &quot;${polish.home}/bin&quot; folder, you 
	easily create <a href="../docs/css-common.html#bitmapfonts">bitmap-fonts</a> out of any True Type font and use them in your
	application. Within the GUI you can use bitmap-fonts by setting the
	&quot;font-bitmap&quot;-attribute in the &quot;polish.css&quot;-file:
<pre>
.myStyle {
	/* Use the coolfont.bmf for this style: */
	font-bitmap: coolfont;
	background-color: green;
}
</pre>
	You can also use bitmap fonts independently of the J2ME Polish GUI
	by using the <a href="../docs/utilities.html#bitmapfont">BitMapFont-class</a>.
	<hr />
	<li><b>Fullscreen-Mode</b>: 
	The full-screen mode is now supported for MIDP/2.0 devices as well. 
	The mode can be set with the &quot;polish.FullScreen&quot;-variable as well, which allows
	a finer grained control than using the &quot;usePolishGui&quot;-attribute of the 
	&lt;build&gt; element:
<pre>
&lt;build
	usePolishGui=&quot;true&quot;
	fullscreen=&quot;menu&quot;
	&gt;
	&lt;variables&gt;
		&lt;variable 
		name=&quot;polish.FullScreen&quot; 
		value=&quot;yes&quot;
		if=&quot;polish.vendor == Siemens&quot;
	/&gt;
	&lt;variables&gt;
	[...]
</pre>
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Automatic Stack Trace Resolving</b>: 
	When an application error occurs during an emulator-session,
	J2ME Polish can decompile and pinpoint the corresponding source-code-location
	directly from error messages like &quot;java.lang.RuntimeException at com.company.MyClass.mymethod(+22)&quot;.
	For this J2ME Polish uses the &quot;jad&quot;-decompiler, which is available at
	<a href="http://www.kpdus.com/jad.html" target="_blank">http://www.kpdus.com/jad.html</a>.
	This is described in more detail in the <a href="../docs/build-emulator.html#emulator-stacktrace">emulator documentation</a>.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Packaging</b>: 
	J2ME Polish can now use different packagers as well, which can be specified with
	the <a href="../docs/build-build.html#packager">&lt;packager&gt; element</a>:
<pre>
&lt;packager
 executable=&quot;jar&quot;
 arguments=&quot;cvfM;;${polish.jarPath};;-C;;${polish.packageDir};;.&quot;
/&gt;
</pre>
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Binary Data Editor</b>: 
	J2ME Polish now includes an editor for binary data files, e.g. level data.
	Have a look at the <a href="../docs/tools.html">&quot;${polish.home}/bin&quot;</a>-directory.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Direct Input Mode</b>: 
	You can activate a <a href="../docs/css-specific.html#textfield-direct-input">direct input mode</a> for textfields by specifying
	<code>textfield-direct-input: true;</code> in the &quot;polish.css&quot;
	file now.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Sony Ericsson Emulators</b>: 
	Emulators from Sony Ericsson can now be launched automatically by J2ME Polish,
	even when they are not integrated in the &quot;normal&quot; WTK.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Lists</b>: 
	In <a href="../docs/css-specific.html#screenattributes">Lists</a> you can now show only the images
	and use the appended texts as titles by setting
	the &quot;show-text-in-title&quot;-CSS-attribute to &quot;true&quot;.
	<hr />
	<li><b>Screens</b>: 
	Improved the layout of &quot;normal&quot; <a href="../docs/css-specific.html#screenattributes">tables</a>, in which each column can use
	as much space as needed (and possible).
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Scrolling Indicator</b>: 
	The scrolling indicator is now painted on the left bottom for Siemens
	devices by default.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Directory Handling</b>: 
	J2ME Polish can now handle absolute paths for the directories as well, e.g.
	&lt;property name=&quot;dir.work&quot; value=&quot;C:\temp\polish&quot; /&gt;.
	<hr />
	<li><b>Obfuscators</b>: 
	J2ME Polish now includes the <a href="http://www.yworkds.de" target="_blank">yGuard</a> obfuscator as well
	and also supports the <a href="http://www.zelix.com/" target="_blank">&quot;KlassMaster&quot;</a>
	and <a href="http://www.preemptive.com/" target="_blank">&quot;Dasho&quot;</a> obfuscators.
	<hr />
	<li><b>Game Engine</b>: 
	Corrected an error when a sprite is created using another sprite while Nokia's UI API
	is available. Also improved the performance of Sprite and LayerManager.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>GUI Commands</b>: 
	Added commands &quot;mark&quot;, &quot;unmark&quot; and &quot;select&quot; to Lists and ChoiceGroups.
	Of course these can be <a href="../docs/localization.html#localization-gui">localized</a> as well.
	They can be deactivated by defining the &lt;variable&gt;s:
<pre>
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.ChoiceGroup.suppressMarkCommands&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.ChoiceGroup.suppressSelectCommand&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.TextField.suppressCommands&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
</pre> 
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Preprocessing</b>: 
	You can now use the new &quot;!=&quot;-operator for comparing values:
<pre>
//#if polish.vendor != Nokia
	// this is not a Nokia device...
//#endif
</pre>
	
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Libraries</b>: 
	The Thread.MIN_PRIORITY had the wrong value 0 instead of 1 in the included midp2.jar library.
	J2ME Polish now also includes the Mobile 3D Graphics API (m3g.jar) as well as the 
	bluetooth API (btapi.jar).
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Device-Selection</b>: 
	All requirements now support the &quot;undefined&quot; value, which means
	that the specified capability must not be defined:
<pre>
&lt;deviceRequirements&gt;
	&lt;or&gt;
		&lt;requirement name=&quot;MaxJarSize&quot; value=&quot;148+ kb&quot; type=&quot;Memory&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;and&gt;
			&lt;requirement name=&quot;StorageSize&quot; value=&quot;148+ kb&quot; type=&quot;Memory&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;requirement name=&quot;MaxJarSize&quot; value=&quot;undefined&quot; type=&quot;Memory&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;/and&gt;
	&lt;/or&gt;
&lt;/deviceRequirements&gt;
</pre>
	<hr />
	When a generic deviceRequirement-type like &quot;Memory&quot;, &quot;String&quot;, &quot;Int&quot; or &quot;Version&quot;
	was used, the name and the value of the requirement got mixed up.
	<hr />
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Thanks</b>: 
	Thanks for this release goes to Andrew Barnes for making the direct input mode
	of TextFields possible, Thomas Kraft for reviewing the forthcoming
	J2ME Polish book, Piotr Czarny, Jon Malmquist, Milosz Weckowski and Thomas Broyer for 
	extensive beta testing, providing excellent bug
	reports and corrections to the device database.
