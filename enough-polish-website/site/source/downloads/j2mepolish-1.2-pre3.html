	<h2 id="improvements12">Improvements of J2ME Polish 1.2 preview 3</h2>
	<p>
	J2ME Polish 1.2 preview 3 contains several bugfixes and improvements compared to the last release:
	</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Resource Assembling</b>:
	The <a href="../docs/build-build.html#resources">&lt;resources&gt; element</a> (a subelement of &lt;build&gt;) can now be 
	used to finetune the automatic resource assembling:
<pre>
&lt;resources
	dir=&quot;resources&quot; 
	defaultexcludes=&quot;yes&quot;
	excludes=&quot;*.db&quot;
 &gt;
	 &lt;fileset 
		dir=&quot;resources/multimedia&quot; 
		includes=&quot;*.mp3&quot; 
		if=&quot;polish.audio.mp3&quot; 
	 /&gt;
	 &lt;fileset 
		dir=&quot;resources/multimedia&quot; 
		includes=&quot;*.mid&quot; 
		if=&quot;polish.audio.midi and !polish.audio.mp3&quot; 
	 /&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;	
</pre>
	Each embedded &lt;fileset&gt; can be selected using the standard
	&quot;if&quot; and &quot;unless&quot;-attributes. In the above examble 
	MIDI soundfiles are only included when the device supports MIDI but no
	MP3s. Instead of using the first fileset all MP3 files could be put into the
	&quot;resources/mp3&quot;-folder as well, by the way.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Localization</b>:
	J2ME Polish now offers a full internationalization framework, with the
	fastest performance and widest localization support possible. Most
	localizations are actually embedded in the source-code, so there is absolutely
	no performance setback. You can also use localized resources, attributes
	and - obviously - messages.
	This is explained at the <a href="../docs/localization.html">localization tutorial</a>.
	The included sample application is now localized for English and German.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Emulator</b>: 
	J2ME Polish can now run emulators as well. These are configured 
	with the <a href="../docs/build-emulator.html">&lt;emulator&gt; element</a>, which is a direct subelement of the &lt;j2mepolish&gt; task.
	So far only emulators based on the Wirless Toolkit are supported.
<pre>
&lt;emulator
	wait=&quot;true&quot;
	trace=&quot;class&quot;
	preferences=&quot;myemulator.properties&quot;
	securityDomain=&quot;trusted&quot;
	enableProfiler=&quot;true&quot;
	enableMemoryMonitor=&quot;true&quot;
	enableNetworkMonitor=&quot;true&quot;
	&gt;
	&lt;parameter name=&quot;-Xjam&quot; value=&quot;transient=http://localhost:8080/${polish.jadName}&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/emulator&gt;
</pre>
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Obfuscator</b>: 
	J2ME Polish now includes the latest ProGuard-version (3.0.7).
	ProGuard 2.0 can still be used, J2ME Polish contains both the stable
	2.1 release as well as the current 3.0.7 release. When the 2.1 release should
	be used, just adjust the classpath of the J2ME Polish task in the 
	&quot;build.xml&quot;, so that it contains the proguard2.jar:
<pre>
&lt;taskdef name=&quot;j2mepolish&quot; 
	classname=&quot;de.enough.polish.ant.PolishTask&quot; 
	classpath=&quot;${polish.home}/import/enough-j2mepolish-build.jar:
	   ${polish.home}/import/jdom.jar:
	   ${polish.home}/import/<b>proguard2.jar</b>&quot;/&gt;
</pre>	
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Compilation</b>: 
	<ul>
		<li><i>javacTarget</i>:
		The &lt;build&gt; element now supports the &quot;javacTarget&quot;-attribute for setting the
		compiler-target. By default the &quot;1.2&quot; target is used, unless a WTK 1.x or Mac OS X is used, in which case the target &quot;1.1&quot; is used.
		Prior versions of J2ME Polish always used the &quot;1.1&quot; target.
<pre>
&lt;build
	...
	javacTarget=&quot;1.1&quot;
	&gt;
</pre>
		<hr />
		</li>
		<li><i>compilerMode</i>: 
		When the compiler-mode is activated, J2ME Polish will not
		package the application and only process one device. 
		This mode is useful for IDEs which
		support indirect compilation like NetBeans for example.
		You can select &quot;Run&quot; in NetBeans and NetBeans
		uses J2ME Polish as compiler, packages the application
		and starts the emulator - this saves valuable time
		during the development phase.
		<br />
		The &quot;compilerDestDir&quot;-attribute defines where the compiled
		(and obfuscated) classes should be stored. The default target directory
		is &quot;bin/classes&quot;.
<pre>
&lt;build
	...
	compilerMode=&quot;true&quot;
	compilerDestDir=&quot;classes&quot;
	&gt;
</pre>
		<hr />
		</li>
		<li><i>Compile Errors</i>:
		Compile errors do now point to the original sources
		instead of pointing to the preprocessed files.
		Within an IDE just click on the error-message to edit
		the faulty source code.
		<hr />
		</li>
		<li><i>Debug Information</i>:
		Full Debug Information is now added to the classes,
		when the &lt;debug&gt; element is activated.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Preprocessing</b>: 
	When preprocessing variables are used, functions can be used to transform
	the values, e.g.
<pre>
//#= long heapSize = ${ bytes( polish.HeapSize ) };
</pre>
	Following functions can be used:
	<ul>
		<li><i>bytes</i>: retrieves the (long) number of bytes of the given memory value.</li>
		<li><i>kilobytes</i>: retrieves the (double) number of kilobytes of the given memory value.</li>
		<li><i>megabytes</i>: retrieves the (double) number of megabytes of the given memory value.</li>
		<li><i>gigabytes</i>: retrieves the (double) number of gigabytes of the given memory value.</li>
		<li><i>uppercase</i>: retrieves the uppercase value.</li>
		<li><i>lowercase</i>: retrieves the lowercase value.</li>
	</ul>
	Functions are also handy for comparing values, e.g.:
<pre>
//#if ${ bytes( polish.HeapSize ) } >= ${ bytes( 100kb ) }
	// heapsize is greater than 100 kb!
//#endif
</pre>

	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>CLDC/1.1 Support</b>: 
	J2ME Polish now contains an API for CLDC/1.1 devices.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Device Database</b>: 
	Updated and added device definitions. 
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>JAD &amp; MANIFEST Attributes</b>: 
	<ul>
		<li><i>target-Attribute</i>: 
	All user-defined attributes are now added to both the
	manifest as well as the JAD file by default. This behaviour
	can be changed by setting the &quot;target&quot;-attribute
	of the &lt;attribute&gt; element:
<pre>
&lt;attribute name=&quot;UDP-Server-Port&quot; value=&quot;5000&quot; target=&quot;jad&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
		<hr />
		</li>
		<li><i>Loading Attribute from a File</i>: 
		Attributes can now be loaded from a file as well:
<pre>
&lt;attribute file=&quot;nokia.jad&quot; if=&quot;polish.vendor == Nokia&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
		In the file attribute-names and -values need to be separated
		with a colon (&quot;:&quot;). Empty lines and lines starting
		with &quot;#&quot; are ignored.
		</li>
		<li><i>Using Variables Within Attributes</i>: 
		Attributes-values can now make use of any defined variables as well, e.g.:
<pre>
&lt;attribute 
	name=&quot;MyApp-HomeUrl&quot; 
	value=&quot;www.company.com/myapp/${polish.language}&quot; /&gt;
&lt;attribute 
	name=&quot;MIDlet-DataSize&quot; 
	value=&quot;${ bytes(polish.DataSize) }&quot; 
	if=&quot;polish.DataSize:defined&quot; /&gt;
</pre>		
		This also applies to attributes defined in the &lt;info&gt; section.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Variables and Parameters</b>: 
		Any variables and parameters can now be loaded from a file as well:
<pre>
&lt;variable file=&quot;nokia.properties&quot; if=&quot;polish.vendor == Nokia&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
		In the file variable-names and -values need to be separated
		with an equals-sign (&quot;=&quot;). Empty lines and lines starting
		with &quot;#&quot; are ignored.
		<hr />
	</li>
	
	<li><b>GUI</b>:
		The DateField now supports the French format of DD/MM/YYYY as well along
		with the ISO, German and US standard.
		The preprocessing-variable &quot;polish.DateFormat&quot; is used to control
		the format, e.g. 
<pre>
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.DateFormat&quot; value=&quot;fr&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
		<hr />
		<br />
		The DateFormat also supports the new generic values &quot;dmy&quot; (day-month-year), 
		&quot;mdy&quot; (month-day-year) or &quot;ymd&quot; (year-month-day).
		Along with the polish.DateFormatSeparator-variable and the
		polish.DateFormatEmptyText-variable one can use any custom dateformat:
<pre>
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.DateFormat&quot; value=&quot;ymd&quot;/&gt;
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.DateFormatSeparator&quot; value=&quot;/&quot;/&gt;
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.DateFormatEmptyText&quot; value=&quot;Select Date&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Device Selection</b>: 
	The new &quot;JavaConfiguration&quot;-requirement eases the selection of devices
	by their configuration:
<pre>
&lt;requirement name=&quot;JavaConfiguration&quot; value=&quot;CLDC/1.1+&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
	<hr/>
	</li>
	<li><b>Preprocessing</b>: 
	<ul>
		<li><i>Preprocessing-Functions</i>: 
	Properties can now be converted using the functions &quot;bytes&quot;, 
	&quot;kilobytes&quot;, &quot;megabytes&quot; and &quot;gigabytes&quot;:
<pre>
//#= long heapSize = ${ bytes( polish.HeapSize ) };
</pre>
		<hr /></li>
		<li><i>If-Directives</i>: 
		In //#if-directives the boolean operators &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot; as well
		as &quot;not&quot; can be used instead of the symbols 
		&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;, &quot;||&quot; and &quot;!&quot;.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<hr/>
	</li>	
	<li><b>Bugs</b>: 
	<ul>	
	<li><i>Obfuscator</i>: 
	The &lt;keep&gt; elements were ignored in the 1.1.1 release, this is fixed
	in the current release.
	<hr /></li>
	<li><i>J2SE 1.5 Support</i>: 
	The J2ME Polish-task could not be used in conjunction with the
	J2SE 1.5 compiler, because the source-compatibility was not set
	correctly and the javac-target was always &quot;1.1&quot;.
	Now the source-compatibility is always set and the javac-target can be changed.
	<hr /></li>
	<li><i>Device-Selection</i>: 
	When a device was selected by its identifier, other devices
	with the similar name were selected as well (e.g. Nokia/7250 and Nokia/7250i).
	<hr />
	The &quot;HeapSize&quot;-requirement was not working correctly, it was
	unable to select any devices.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><i>Using Identifier in #if-directive</i>: 
	Identifiers could not be compared in #if-preprocesing directives directly.
	This is now fixed:
<pre>
//#if polish.Identifier == Nokia/N95 
</pre>
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><i>Setting of Select-Text</i>: 
	The "polish.command.select" variable was ignored, now it
	sets the label of select-commands as expected.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><i>Detection of Ticker</i>: 
	The J2ME Polish GUI did not always detect all setTicker(Ticker) and getTicker()
	method calls, which resulted in a compile error. This is now fixed.
	</li>
	
	</ul>
	<hr/>
	<li><b>Thanks</b>: 
	Thanks for this release goes to Thomas Broyer for the improvements 
	of the DateField class and new preprocessing directives, 
	Jan Peknik for suggesting the
	compiler-mode, attributes-loading and &quot;bending&quot; of compiler-messages
	(as well as explaining how this can be done),
	Achim Arrasz for suggesting the inclusion of debug-information during
	compilation, Kostas Kakoulis for bug reports,
	 Jozart for starting the &quot;javac-target&quot;-discussion as well as 
	 providing excellent background information,
	Sebastian Szczygiel for improvements of the device database,
	And thanks to all you users of J2ME Polish!
