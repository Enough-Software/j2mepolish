<p>
	The 1.0 release throws a NullPointerException in some circumstances, 
	when the J2ME Polish GUI is not	used. Also the device-definition
	of the Nokia/6100 contained a wrong screen-size. The 
	1.0.1 release
	fixes these errors.
</p>
	<h2 id="improvements100">Improvements of J2ME Polish 1.0</h2>
	<p>
	After nine months of intense programming, the 1.0 release of J2ME Polish
	has now been released.
	J2ME Polish 1.0 contains several bugfixes and improvements compared to the last release:
	</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>GUI</b>: some memory optimizations result in smaller
	JAR files as well as less heap usage.
	<hr/>
	DateField did not return correctly after editing. This behaviour has been fixed.
	<hr/>
	Some new borders and backgrounds:
	<ul>
		<li>circle-border: a border which draws a simple circle.</li>
		<li>circle-background: a background which draws a simple circle.</li>
		<li>pulsating-circle-background: an animated background which draws a circle, which
		is constantly growing and shrinking.</li>
		<li>pulsating-circles-background: an animated background which draws 
		ever-growing circles.</li>
	</ul>
	<hr/>
	</li>
	<li><b>JAD- and Manifest-Attributes</b>: 
	Custom attributes will now be copied only into the JAD file,
	unless a manifest attributes-filter is used.
	<hr/>
	</li>
	<li><b>Device Database</b>: 
	Updated and added device definitions. Also added the new &quot;Generic/jsr185&quot;
	device, which represents a standard MIDP/2.0 device with WMAPI and MMAPI support.
	<hr/>
	<li><b>Preprocessing</b>: The new #message directive can
	be used to analyse the behaviour of the preprocessing phase:
	<pre>
	//#message Using update-url &quot;${update-url}&quot;.
	</pre>
	<hr/>
	</li>
</ul>
