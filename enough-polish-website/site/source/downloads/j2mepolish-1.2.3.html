	<h2 id="improvements123">Improvements of J2ME Polish 1.2.3</h2>
	<p>
	J2ME Polish 1.2.3 brings a full screen UI for all MIDP/2.0 phones,
	the ability to automatically resolve stack traces like 
	&quot;RuntimeException at at com.company.MyClass.mymethod(+22)&quot;,
	an editor for binary files like level-data, the ability to
	use different packagers, and
	provides many small but fine improvements, a couple of
	bug fixes and an updated device database as well as documentation:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Bitmap Fonts</b>: 
	Using the font-editor in the &quot;${polish.home}/bin&quot; folder, you 
	easily create <a href="../docs/css-common.html#bitmapfonts">bitmap-fonts</a> out of any True Type font and use them in your
	application. Within the GUI you can use bitmap-fonts by setting the
	&quot;font-bitmap&quot;-attribute in the &quot;polish.css&quot;-file:
<pre>
.myStyle {
	/* Use the coolfont.bmf for this style: */
	font-bitmap: coolfont;
	background-color: green;
}
</pre>
	You can also use bitmap fonts independently of the J2ME Polish GUI
	by using the <a href="../docs/utilities.html#bitmapfont">BitMapFont-class</a>.
	<hr />
	<li><b>Fullscreen-Mode</b>: 
	The full-screen mode is now supported for MIDP/2.0 devices as well. 
	The mode can be set with the &quot;polish.FullScreen&quot;-variable as well, which allows
	a finer grained control than using the &quot;usePolishGui&quot;-attribute of the 
	&lt;build&gt; element:
<pre>
&lt;build
	usePolishGui=&quot;true&quot;
	fullscreen=&quot;menu&quot;
	&gt;
	&lt;variables&gt;
		&lt;variable 
		name=&quot;polish.FullScreen&quot; 
		value=&quot;yes&quot;
		if=&quot;polish.vendor == Siemens&quot;
	/&gt;
	&lt;variables&gt;
	[...]
</pre>
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Automatic Stack Trace Resolving</b>: 
	When an application error occurs during an emulator-session,
	J2ME Polish can decompile and pinpoint the corresponding source-code-location
	directly from error messages like &quot;java.lang.RuntimeException at com.company.MyClass.mymethod(+22)&quot;.
	For this J2ME Polish uses the &quot;jad&quot;-decompiler, which is available at
	<a href="http://www.kpdus.com/jad.html" target="_blank">http://www.kpdus.com/jad.html</a>.
	This is described in more detail in the <a href="../docs/build-emulator.html#emulator-stacktrace">emulator documentation</a>.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Packaging</b>: 
	J2ME Polish can now use different packagers as well, which can be specified with
	the <a href="../docs/build-build.html#packager">&lt;packager&gt; element</a>:
<pre>
&lt;packager
 executable=&quot;jar&quot;
 arguments=&quot;cvfM;;${polish.jarPath};;-C;;${polish.packageDir};;.&quot;
/&gt;
</pre>
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Binary Data Editor</b>: 
	J2ME Polish now includes an editor for binary data files, e.g. level data.
	Have a look at the <a href="../docs/tools.html">&quot;${polish.home}/bin&quot;</a>-directory.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Direct Input Mode</b>: 
	You can activate a <a href="../docs/css-specific.html#textfield-direct-input">direct input mode</a> for textfields by specifying
	<code>textfield-direct-input: true;</code> in the &quot;polish.css&quot;
	file now.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Sony Ericsson Emulators</b>: 
	Emulators from Sony Ericsson can now be launched automatically by J2ME Polish,
	even when they are not integrated in the &quot;normal&quot; WTK.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Lists</b>: 
	In <a href="../docs/css-specific.html#screenattributes">Lists</a> you can now show only the images
	and use the appended texts as titles by setting
	the &quot;show-text-in-title&quot;-CSS-attribute to &quot;true&quot;.
	<hr />
	<li><b>Screens</b>: 
	Improved the layout of &quot;normal&quot; <a href="../docs/css-specific.html#screenattributes">tables</a>, in which each column can use
	as much space as needed (and possible).
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Scrolling Indicator</b>: 
	The scrolling indicator is now painted on the left bottom for Siemens
	devices by default.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Directory Handling</b>: 
	J2ME Polish can now handle absolute paths for the directories as well, e.g.
	&lt;property name=&quot;dir.work&quot; value=&quot;C:\temp\polish&quot; /&gt;.
	<hr />
	<li><b>Obfuscators</b>: 
	J2ME Polish now includes the <a href="http://www.yworkds.de" target="_blank">yGuard</a> obfuscator as well
	and also supports the <a href="http://www.zelix.com/" target="_blank">&quot;KlassMaster&quot;</a>
	and <a href="http://www.preemptive.com/" target="_blank">&quot;Dasho&quot;</a> obfuscators.
	<hr />
	<li><b>Game Engine</b>: 
	Corrected an error when a sprite is created using another sprite while Nokia's UI API
	is available. Also improved the performance of Sprite and LayerManager.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>GUI Commands</b>: 
	Added commands &quot;mark&quot;, &quot;unmark&quot; and &quot;select&quot; to Lists and ChoiceGroups.
	Of course these can be <a href="../docs/localization.html#localization-gui">localized</a> as well.
	They can be deactivated by defining the &lt;variable&gt;s:
<pre>
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.ChoiceGroup.suppressMarkCommands&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.ChoiceGroup.suppressSelectCommand&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.TextField.suppressCommands&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
</pre> 
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Preprocessing</b>: 
	You can now use the new &quot;!=&quot;-operator for comparing values:
<pre>
//#if polish.vendor != Nokia
	// this is not a Nokia device...
//#endif
</pre>
	
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Libraries</b>: 
	The Thread.MIN_PRIORITY had the wrong value 0 instead of 1 in the included midp2.jar library.
	J2ME Polish now also includes the Mobile 3D Graphics API (m3g.jar) as well as the 
	bluetooth API (btapi.jar).
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Device-Selection</b>: 
	All requirements now support the &quot;undefined&quot; value, which means
	that the specified capability must not be defined:
<pre>
&lt;deviceRequirements&gt;
	&lt;or&gt;
		&lt;requirement name=&quot;MaxJarSize&quot; value=&quot;148+ kb&quot; type=&quot;Memory&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;and&gt;
			&lt;requirement name=&quot;StorageSize&quot; value=&quot;148+ kb&quot; type=&quot;Memory&quot;/&gt;
			&lt;requirement name=&quot;MaxJarSize&quot; value=&quot;undefined&quot; type=&quot;Memory&quot;/&gt;
		&lt;/and&gt;
	&lt;/or&gt;
&lt;/deviceRequirements&gt;
</pre>
	<hr />
	When a generic deviceRequirement-type like &quot;Memory&quot;, &quot;String&quot;, &quot;Int&quot; or &quot;Version&quot;
	was used, the name and the value of the requirement got mixed up.
	<hr />
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Thanks</b>: 
	Thanks for this release goes to Andrew Barnes for making the direct input mode
	of TextFields possible, Thomas Kraft for reviewing the forthcoming
	J2ME Polish book, Piotr Czarny, Jon Malmquist, Milosz Weckowski and Thomas Broyer for 
	extensive beta testing, providing excellent bug
	reports and corrections to the device database.
