	<h2 id="improvements12">Improvements of J2ME Polish 1.2 preview 2</h2>
	<p>
	J2ME Polish 1.2 preview 2 contains several bugfixes and improvements compared to the last release:
	</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Obfuscator</b>: 
	J2ME Polish now includes the latest ProGuard-version (3.0.2).
	ProGuard 2.0 can still be used, just use the "ProGuard2"-
	instead of the "ProGuard"-obfuscator.
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Compilation</b>: 
	<ul>
		<li><i>javacTarget</i>:
		The &lt;build&gt; element now supports the &quot;javacTarget&quot;-attribute for setting the
		compiler-target. By default the &quot;1.2&quot; target is used, unless a WTK 1.x or Mac OS X is used, in which case the target &quot;1.1&quot; is used.
		Prior versions of J2ME Polish always used the &quot;1.1&quot; target.
<pre>
&lt;build
	...
	javacTarget=&quot;1.1&quot;
	&gt;
</pre>
		<hr />
		</li>
		<li><i>compilerMode</i>: 
		When the compiler-mode is activated, J2ME Polish will not
		package the application and only process one device. 
		This mode is useful for IDEs which
		support indirect compilation like NetBeans for example.
		You can select &quot;Run&quot; in NetBeans and NetBeans
		uses J2ME Polish as compiler, packages the application
		and starts the emulator - this saves valuable time
		during the development phase.
		<br />
		The &quot;compilerDestDir&quot;-attribute defines where the compiled
		(and obfuscated) classes should be stored. The default target directory
		is &quot;bin/classes&quot;.
<pre>
&lt;build
	...
	compilerMode=&quot;true&quot;
	compilerDestDir=&quot;classes&quot;
	&gt;
</pre>
		<hr />
		</li>
		<li><i>Compile Errors</i>:
		Compile errors do now point to the original sources
		instead of pointing to the preprocessed files.
		Within an IDE just click on the error-message to edit
		the faulty source code.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Device Database</b>: 
	Updated and added device definitions. 
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>JAD & MANIFEST Attributes</b>: 
	<ul>
		<li><i>target-Attribute</i>: 
	All user-defined attributes are now added to both the
	manifest as well as the JAD file by default. This behaviour
	can be changed by setting the &quot;target&quot;-attribute
	of the &lt;attribute&gt; element:
<pre>
	&lt;attribute name=&quot;UDP-Server-Port&quot; value=&quot;5000&quot; target=&quot;jad&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
		<hr />
		</li>
		<li><i>Loading Attribute from a File</i>: 
		Attributes can now be loaded from a file as well:
<pre>
	&lt;attribute file=&quot;nokia.jad&quot; if=&quot;polish.vendor == Nokia&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
		In the file attribute-names and -values need to be separated
		with a colon (&quot;:&quot;). Empty lines and lines starting
		with &quot;#&quot; are ignored.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Variables</b>: 
		Variables can now be loaded from a file as well:
<pre>
	&lt;variable file=&quot;nokia.properties&quot; if=&quot;polish.vendor == Nokia&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
		In the file variable-names and -values need to be separated
		with an equals-sign (&quot;=&quot;). Empty lines and lines starting
		with &quot;#&quot; are ignored.
		<hr />
	</li>
	
	<li><b>GUI</b>:
		The DateField now supports the French format of DD/MM/YYYY as well along
		with the ISO, German and US standard.
		The preprocessing-variable &quot;polish.DateFormat&quot; is used to control
		the format, e.g. 
<pre>
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.DateFormat&quot; value=&quot;fr&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
		<hr />
		<br />
		The DateFormat also supports the new generic values &quot;dmy&quot; (day-month-year), 
		&quot;mdy&quot; (month-day-year) or &quot;ymd&quot; (year-month-day).
		Along with the polish.DateFormatSeparator-variable and the
		polish.DateFormatEmptyText-variable one can use any custom dateformat:
<pre>
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.DateFormat&quot; value=&quot;ymd&quot;/&gt;
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.DateFormatSeparator&quot; value=&quot;/&quot;/&gt;
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.DateFormatEmptyText&quot; value=&quot;Select Date&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
	<hr />
	</li>
	<li><b>Device Selection</b>: 
	The new &quot;JavaConfiguration&quot;-requirement eases the selection of devices
	by their configuration:
<pre>
&lt;requirement name=&quot;JavaConfiguration&quot; value=&quot;CLDC/1.1+&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
	<hr/>
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Bugs</b>: 
	<ul>
	<li><i>J2SE 1.5 Support</i>: 
	The J2ME Polish-task could not be used in conjunction with the
	J2SE 1.5 compiler, because the source-compatibility was not set
	correctly and the javac-target was always &quot;1.1&quot;.
	Now the source-compatibility is always set and the javac-target can be changed.
	<hr /></li>
	<li><i>Device-Selection</i>: 
	When a device was selected by its identifier, other devices
	with the similar name were selected as well (e.g. Nokia/7250 and Nokia/7250i).
	<hr /></li>
	<li><i>Using Identifier in #if-directive</i>: 
	Identifiers could not be compared in #if-preprocesing directives directly.
	This is now fixed:
<pre>
//#if polish.Identifier == Nokia/N95 
</pre>
	</li>
	</ul>
	<hr/>
	<li><b>Thanks</b>: 
	Thanks for this release goes to Thomas Broyer for the improvements 
	of the DateField class, Jan Peknik for suggesting the
	compiler-mode, attributes-loading and &quot;bending&quot; of compiler-messages
	(as well as explaining how this can be done),
	 Jozart for starting the &quot;javac-target&quot;-discussion,
	Sebastian Szczygiel for improvements of the device database,
	And thanks to all you users of J2ME Polish!
