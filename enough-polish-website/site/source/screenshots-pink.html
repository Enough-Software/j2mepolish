	<h1>Screenshots</h1>
	<p>J2ME Polish makes it easy to adjust the design to specific devices or
	device groups. You can try completely different designs just
	by using a different resources-folder. For the application
	screen-shots a simple <a href="screenshot-application.html">application</a> is used, which just shows
	a main menu with the standard <code>javax.microedition.lcdui.List</code> 
	class.</p>

/* The polish.css files contains all

   It can be adjusted for specific devices

   If you want to adjust a design for all
   Nokia devices, define it in resources/Nokia/polish.css
   and so on. Only new and different settings
   need to be specified in such polish.css files. 
   To keep this example easy, no subfolders are
   actually used here.
