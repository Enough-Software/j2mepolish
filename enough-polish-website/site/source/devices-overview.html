	<p>
		J2ME Polish includes a device database, which contains
		all known J2ME devices and which can be extended easily.
		<br/>
		This database can be used for 
		<a href="docs/build-deviceRequirements.html">selecting</a> the 
		target devices and for 
		<a href="docs/optimization.html">optimizing</a> 
		the application without
		losing the portability of the application: Any capability
		or feature of a device can be accessed during the 
		<a href="docs/preprocessing.html">preprocessing</a> phase,
		an often needed example is checking the API support of
		a device:
<pre>
//#if polish.api.mmapi || polish.midp2
	// this device either supports the 
	// Mobile Media API or the MIDP/2.0 standard
//#endif
</pre>
