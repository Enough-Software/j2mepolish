	<h1 id="top">Platforms</h1>
<p>
J2ME Polish can be adjusted to support several platforms that support more than the normal MIDP profile.
The key for this support is the <i>${polish.home}/platforms.xml</i> file (visible only if you install the external device database), 
inclusion of platform specific (boot) classpaths, and the automatic selection and invocation of preprocessors, 
postcompilers, finalizers and so on.
</p>
<p>
Following Platforms are supported by J2ME Polish:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="platform-android.html">Android</a></li>
	<li><a href="platform-blackberry.html">BlackBerry</a></li>
	<li><a href="platform-midp.html">J2ME/Java ME MIDP</a></li>
	<li><a href="platform-javase.html">Java SE</a></li>
	<li><a href="platform-windowsphone.html">Windows Phone</a> (with additional licensing/services)</li>

</ul>
