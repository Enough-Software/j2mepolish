	<h1 id="top">Assembling of Resources and Localization</h1>
	<p>
	J2ME Polish assembles resources and creates localized versions of your
	application automatically. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The actual resource assembling is quite easy - just put all general resources
	into the &quot;resources&quot; folder of your project and put specialized 
	resources into the appropriate subfolder, e.g. all Nokia-resources into
	&quot;resources/Nokia&quot;, any Siemens-SX1-resources into &quot;resources/Siemens/SX1&quot;,
	any MP3 files into &quot;resources/mp3&quot; and any high-color images into
	&quot;resources/BitsPerColor.16+&quot;.
	<br />This process can be fine tuned using the 
	<a href="build-build.html#resources">&lt;resources&gt; element</a> so that
	for example MIDI files are only added when the device does not support MP3 
	and so forth.
	</p>
	<p>
	J2ME Polish has the best ever localization framework which has absolutely 
	no overhead in optimal cases, since localized messages are actually embedded
	directly in the source-code.
