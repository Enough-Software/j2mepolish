<h1 id="top">Developing for Java SE</h1>
<p>
You can create a project for Java SE just by adding the device 
<a href="http://devices.j2mepolish.org/interactivedb/searchdevices.faces?term=polish.Identifier.Generic/Java" target="_blank">Generic/Java</a> 
to the list of target devices in your 
<a href="build-deviceRequirements.html">build.xml</a> script.
</p>
<p>
J2ME Polish will then integrate the <a href="http://microemu.org"  target="_blank">microemulator</a>, so that
you can just double click the generated JAR file for starting the application - you only need to have Java installed for that.
</p>
<h2 id="knownlimitations">Known Limitations</h2>
<p>
There are a couple of limitations of this approach at the moment:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>MIDlet.getAppProperty()</b>: JAD or MANIFEST attributes are not supported.</li>
	<li><b>API Limitations</b>: Currently only following APIs are supported: wmapi, mmapi, btapi and pdaapi.</li>
	<li><b>Full Emulator</b>: The emulator menu is visible and no device skin is integrated.</li>
	<!-- 
	<li><b></b>: </li>
	-->
</ul>
