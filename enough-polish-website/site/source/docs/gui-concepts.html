	<h1 id="top">Designing Your Mobile Applications</h1>
	<p>
	J2ME Polish combines the power of the mobile Java world with the flexibility of webdesigns by separating the 
	design settings from the application's source code. By using the 
web-standard Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), customizing and designing of applications becomes very easy and flexible. 
With J2ME Polish any web-designer can now design mobile 
applications, while the programmers can concentrate on the business logic!
</p>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<p>
	The J2ME Polish &quot;Lush UI&quot; uses some basic concepts:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Develop your UI with the normal <code>javax.microedition.lcdui</code> classes like Form, List or TextField (alternatively import <a href="gui-visualguide.html">de.enough.polish.ui</a> classes directly).</li>
	<li>Use additionally J2ME Polish <a href="gui-visualguide.html">custom components</a> like TabbedForm, TreeItem, ChoiceTextField and so on.</li>
	<li>If you need further control over standard <code>javax.microedition.lcdui</code> components like setting the input mode of an TextField, use
	<a href="<%= javadocdir %>../javadoc/j2me/de/enough/polish/ui/UiAccess.html">de.enough.polish.ui.UiAccess</a>.</li>
	<li>Add <a href="preprocessing-directives.html#style">#style</a> directives to your applications source code for connecting your code with the design</li>
	<li>Design and customize your application by using simple CSS texfiles, by default <i>resources/polish.css</i>.</li>
	<li>Configure additional UI options in your <i>build.xml</i> script.</li>
	<!--  
	<li></li>
	-->
</ul>
<h2 id="glance">A Quick Glance at CSS</h2>
<p>
All design settings and files are stored by default in the <i>resources</i> directory of the project, 
unless another directory has been specified in your <i>build.xml</i> script. 
The most important file is <i>polish.css</i> in that directory. All design definitions can be found here. The design definitions are grouped in &quot;styles&quot;. A style can be assigned to any UI item like a title, a paragraph or an input field. Within a style several attributes and its values are defined:
<pre>
.myStyle {
	font-color: white;
	font-style: bold;
	font-size: large;
	font-face: proportional;
	background {
		type: vertical-gradient;
		top-color: #333;
		bottom-color: #000;
	}
}
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example the style called &quot;myStyle&quot; defines some font values and the color of the background. Every style contains a selector as well as a number of attributes and its values:
</p>
<p>
Each attribute-value pair must be trailed by a semicolon. All attribute-value pairs 
needs to be enclosed by curly brackets. The selector or name of style is 
case-insensitive, so &quot;.MySTYle&quot; is the same as &quot;.myStyle&quot;.
Apart from the <i>polish.css</i> file, you can put images and other contents into the <i>resources</i> folder. 
Subfolders are used for styles and content for specific devices and groups. 
You can put all resources for Nokia devices into the &quot;Nokia&quot; folder and resources 
for Samsung's E700 into the &quot;Samsung/E700&quot; folder. 
This is described in more detail in the 
<a href="customization.html">&quot;Customization&quot;</a> section.
</p><p>
You can specify styles directly for UI items with the <a href="preprocessing-directives.html#style">#style</a> preprocessing directive in the 
source code. Alternatively you can use the dynamic names of the UI items, e.g. 
&quot;p&quot; for text-items, &quot;a&quot; for hyperlinks or &quot;form p&quot; for all 
text-items which are embedded in a form.
</p>
<p>
Styles can extend other styles with the <code>extends</code> keyword, e.g.<code>.myStyle extends 
baseStyle {}</code>. Pseudo style such as <code>myItem:hover</code> automatically inherit attributes from their base style.</p>
<p>
J2ME Polish supports the CSS box model with margins, paddings and content. Other common 
design settings include the background, the border and font-settings.
</p>
<p> 
All these basic concepts are described in the 
<a href="gui-css-basics.html">&quot;CSS basics&quot;</a> section.
</p><p>
Attributes for specific UI items as well as the details of the different backgrounds, 
borders, text-effects, screen transitions, item views and RGB filters are detailed in the  
<a href="gui-visualguide.html">&quot;visual guide&quot;</a>.
