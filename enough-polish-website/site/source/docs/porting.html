	<h1 id="top">Porting</h1>

<p>
Porting is done in J2ME Polish in various ways:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Rich APIs</b>: our APIs are programmed in a defensive way and adapt themselves automatically to different devices, platforms and known issues.</li>
	<li><b>PostCompiler</b>: PostCompiler use compiled classes and search for problematic code. An specific example includes accessing <code>System.arrayCopy()</code> on a Nokia N80 with Vodafone firmware version - such devices behave very badly to such calls and thus we replace them during the build process.</li>
	<li><b>Preprocessing</b>: You can adjust and control your source code using <a href="preprocessing.html">Preprocessing</a>.</li>
	<!-- 
	<li><b></b>: </li>
	 -->
</ul>
