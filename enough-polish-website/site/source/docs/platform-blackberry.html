<h1 id="top">Developing for BlackBerry Devices</h1>
	<%index %>
<p>
The BlackBerry platform of Research in Motion is quite popular for business applications. 
You can develop normal MIDlets as well as BlackBerry specific applications with J2ME Polish.
</p>
<h2 id="blackberry-preparation">Preparations</h2>
<p>
For transforming and signing the JAR files to the BlackBerry proprietary COD format, you need to install either 
the BlackBerry Java Development Environment (JDE) or the BlackBerry Component Packages. The component packages are sufficient,
though the JDE eases the debugging of your applications.
</p>
<p>
Please note that your should install the corresponding versions of the JDE/Component Packages for each BlackBerry handset version 
that you want to target. So if you are targeting 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 BlackBerry devices, you need to install each of the corresponding JDEs.
J2ME Polish will then select the appropriate JDE for converting a JAR file into a COD file. This is necessary since COD files
generated with new JDE versions will not run on older platforms, and COD files generated with older JDE versions will not allow you
(and J2ME Polish) to take advantage of features of later versions.
</p>
<p>
Download the JDEs or the Component Packages from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blackberry.com/developers" target="_blank">http://www.blackberry.com/developers</a>. 
On Unix systems these can be installed using an windows emulator like <a href="http://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a>. 
You can also install the Component Packages under Windows and then copy the installed directories to other operation systems.
</p>
<p>
After the installation you should define the <code>blackberry.home</code> in either <i>${polish.home}/global.properties</i>, 
${project.home}/${user.name}.properties or in your <i>build.xml</i> script.
<code>blackberry.home</code> should point to the directory that contains all JDEs or Component Packages. By default this points to
&quot;C:/Program Files/Research In Motion&quot;. In your <i>build.xml</i> script the definitition could look like this:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;property 
	name=&quot;blackberry.home&quot; 
	location=&quot;C:/Program Files/Research In Motion&quot; 
/&gt;
</pre>

<h2 id="blackberry-samplesetup">Sample JDE Installation Structure</h2>
<p>
If you work in a team, it is a good idea to install the Component Packages into a shared project. In this way you can use one installation
setup for several projects and teams easily. It also eases the sharing of signing certificates considerably (see below).
For our projects we do have installed all Component Packages into the "blackberry" project with following directory structure:
</p>
<pre>
blackberry                           (root directory)
blackberry/blackberry.properties     (signing properties)
blackberry/certificate               (certificate directory)
blackberry/certificate/sigtool.csk   (private key)
blackberry/certificate/sigtool.db    (signing services)
blackberry/certificate/client-RBB-XXXX.csi (certificate)
blackberry/certificate/client-RCR-XXXX.csi (certificate)
blackberry/certificate/client-RRT-XXXX.csi (certificate)
blackberry/BlackBerry JDE Component Package 4.5.0 (for 4.5 devices)
blackberry/BlackBerry JDE Component Package 4.6.0 (for 4.6 devices)
blackberry/BlackBerry JDE Component Package 4.7.0 (for 4.7 devices)
blackberry/BlackBerry JDE Component Package 5.0.0 (for 5.0 devices)
blackberry/BlackBerry JDE Component Package 6.0.0 (for 6.0 devices)
blackberry/BlackBerry JDE Component Package 7.0.0 (for 7.0 devices)
</pre>
<p>
In project's we then use following property definitions in the <i>build.xml</i> scripts for BlackBerry support:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;project basedir=&quot;.&quot; default=&quot;j2mepolish&quot; name=&quot;myproject&quot;&gt;
	&lt;property file=&quot;${user.name}.properties&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;property name=&quot;polish.home&quot; location=&quot;C:\Program Files\J2ME-Polish&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;property file=&quot;${polish.home}/global.properties&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;property name=&quot;blackberry.home&quot; location=&quot;../blackberry&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;property file=&quot;${blackberry.home}/blackberry.properties&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The above property structure allows you to use user-specific settings in case you cannot deal with the general team-settings, while
easing the life of all team members considerably.
You can change <code>blackberry.home</code> for example by specifying it in <i>${project.home}/${user.name}/properties</i>, e.g. when
your login name is "dave", you can define it in <i>${project.home}/dave.properties</i> like this:
</p>
<pre>
blackberry.home=E:\\dev\\Research in Motion
</pre>
<p>You can also define the variable <code>blackberry.emulator.home</code> in case you want to use different JDEs for building
and for simulating. This is handy if you have the certification keys in one place and fullblown JDEs in a different place.
</p>
<pre>
blackberry.emulator.home=E:\\dev\\Research in Motion
</pre>


<h2 id="blackberry-jar2cod">Converting JARs into CODs</h2>
<p>
When you target BlackBerry devices like the BlackBerry/8100 device and have set the <code>blackberry.home</code> property, 
J2ME Polish will automatically invoke the rapc compiler for converting the JAR file into a COD file in the finalize step 
of the build process. 
</p>
<p>If rapc fails because there is not enough heapspace, you can specify the preprocessing variable or Ant property 
<code>blackberry.rapc.opts</code>, e.g.:<br />
<code>&lt;property name=&quot;blackberry.rapc.opts&quot; value=&quot;-Xmx512m&quot;/&gt;</code><br />
This example will set the maximum usable heapspace to 512 MB, which is actually the default setting.
</p>

<h2 id="blackberry-signing">Signing COD Files</h2>
<p>
J2ME Polish can also automate the requesting of signatures during the build process. 
</p>
<h3 id="blackberry-signing-obtaining">Obtaining and Installing Certificates</h3>
<p>
Signatures are required for accessing some Blackberry specific security sensitive APIs and require a certificate that can be obtained
at <a href="https://www.blackberry.com/SignedKeys/" target="_blank">https://www.blackberry.com/SignedKeys</a>. 
After signing up with BlackBerry you will receive 3 certificates, for example:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>client-RBB-34343989.csi</li>
	<li>client-RCR-34343989.csi</li>
	<li>client-RRT-34343989.csi</li>
</ol>
<p>
Each certificate is responsible for specific API usages, usually the RRT (secure runtime API access) is the most important.
You now need to register the certificates by following the installation 
instructions - usually double clicking the certificate does the trick. After the installation you will obtain the two text files
<i>sigtool.csk</i> and <i>sigtool.db</i> that will be stored in <i>${jde.home}/bin</i>.
</p>
<h3 id="blackberry-signing-using">Automating the Application Signing</h3>
<p>
In your Ant <i>build.xml</i> script, <i>${polish.home}/global.properties</i> or <i>${project.home}/${user.name}.properties</i>
 you then need to define the <code>blackberry.certificate.dir</code> property, e.g.:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;property name=&quot;blackberry.certificate.dir&quot; location=&quot;${blackberry.home}/certificates&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
In case the sigtool.csk and sigtool.db files are not included in the same location like the certificates, you also need to define the <code>blackberry.sigtool.dir</code> property:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;property name=&quot;blackberry.sigtool.dir&quot; location=&quot;${blackberry.home}/sigtool&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
When you specify the password as well, J2ME Polish uses this for requesting the signatures without manual intervention. 
For such cases the password needs to contain only ASCII characters, otherwise J2ME Polish can't include the password automatically.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;property name=&quot;blackberry.certificate.password&quot; value=&quot;secret&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
<p>Note that BlackBerry only provides a GUI based tool for JDEs before 2.0.1.
For successfully signing your application automatically you
need to run the build process in the foreground, so that the J2ME Polish can send key events to the foreground window 
of the BlackBerry SigTool during the build with such JDEs.
</p>
<p>
Note also that the blackberry SigTool application does not work on Unix systems. This shlashdev guide describes 
<a href="http://www.slashdev.ca/2008/03/16/using-sigtool-in-linux" target="_blank">how to run the SigTool on Unix</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="blackberry-debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p>
An blackberry project file (.jdp) gets created automatically with every blackberry build. You can debug by building and running
the project in the BlackBerry JDE with this generated project file. You will find the file in the <i>build/BlackBerry/${device}/{language}/</i> folder.
<br />
To import a project right-click on the workspace in the <i>files</i> view of the JDE and select &quot;Add Project...&quot;.
</p>
<p>
In case you use <a href="build-build.html#libraries">binary libraries</a> in your project, J2ME Polish will generate two projects - one library project and another CLDC application 
project that depends on the generated library project. You will need to add both projects to the JDE - the library project will be called like your application 
with an additional &quot;LIB&quot; at the end.
</p>
<p>
When you are using the <a href="serialization.html">serialization</a> or <a href="rmi.html">RMI</a> features of J2ME Polish, you should not rely on 
<code>de.enough.polish.io.Serializable</code> but instead implement <code>de.enough.polish.io.Externalizable</code> when using running projects from
within the JDE. This is required since Serializable classes are processed within the class files in byte code, but in the JDE only the source code is used.
</p>
<h2 id="blackberry-verification-erros">Verification error</h2>
<p>
It may happen that a blackberry build can't be executed due to a verification error. The device will respond to the execution of the application with something like this :
</p>
<pre>
Error starting appname: Module 'appname' has verification error XXXX at offset XXXX
</pre>
<p>
There are numerous reasons for this behavior:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The signing went wrong. Please check the signing of the application.</li>
  <li>A derived or subclass of another class tries to access a static variable directly.
  Create a get() method for this variable to access it.</li>
  <li>Remove unused imports</li>
  <li>Remove System.out.println() calls</li>
  <li>Make sure every method has a valid qualifier like private/public/protected
</ul>
<p>
To identify the class and method which causes the error, you can do the following :
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the emulator of the BlackBerry JDE</li>
<li>Load the application</li>
<li>Open the application</li>
<li>An error screen should appear stating something like this : <pre>jvm error 104 uncaught runtime exception</pre></li>
<li>Choose from the underlying menu (using the arrow keys) the option "catfail"</li>
<li>Now choose the right most point to save a file named "failure.zip" to your disk</li>
<li>Extract the files within failure.zip to your disk and open the .bug file</li>
</ol>
<p>
There are three interesting values in the .bug file:
</p>
<pre>VM:VECPs</pre>
<p>(the package)</p>
<pre>VM:VECCs</pre>
<p>(the class)</p>
<pre>VM:VECMm</pre>
<p>(and the method which causes the error)</p>
<h2 id="blackberry-gui">Using the J2ME Polish UI on BlackBerry Devices</h2>
<p>
The J2ME Polish UI can be used normally on BlackBerry devices as well. In order to make most of the system, 
J2ME Polish converts your MIDlet into a native BlackBerry UiApplication. 
This allows J2ME Polish to process trackwheel/trackball events and so on correctly. 
The successful conversion requires that your MIDlet uses a public constructor. 
</p>
<h3 id="blackberry-gui-textfield">BlackBerry TextFields</h3>
<p>
On BlackBerry devices native BlackBerry <code>EditFields</code> are used for text input. These native fields
work in the same way like in other BlackBerry applications, but they do not offer the same wealth of design options
like J2ME Polish <a href="gui-item-textfield.html">TextFields</a>.
<br />
Therefore, J2ME Polish displays normal <code>TextFields</code> that you can fully design when the field is not focused.
When the <code>TextField</code> is focused, however, we switch to the native BlackBerry <code>EditFields</code>. You can still
specify the background, border and font styles of a focused <code>TextField</code>, but advanced designs like 
<a href="gui-visualguide-texteffects.html">text effects</a> will not be supported.
</p>
<h3 id="blackberry-gui-datefield">BlackBerry DateFields</h3>
<p>
Similar to <code>TextFields</code>, J2ME Polish uses native BlackBerry  <code>DateFields</code> when a J2ME Polish
<a href="gui-item-datefield.html">DateField</a> is focused. 
This is why the visualization of the  <code>DateField</code> might change when it is focused.
</p>

<h3 id="blackberry-gui-menubar">BlackBerry Menubar</h3>
<p>
J2ME Polish uses the <code>fullscreen</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;build&gt;</code> element of the <code>&lt;j2mepolish&gt;</code> task to determine
whether commands should be rendered by J2ME Polish or natively by BlackBerry. We recommend to use native command rendering on BlackBerry which is achieved 
with one of the following settings:
</p>
<pre>&lt;build fullscreen=&quot;false&quot; ...&gt;</pre>
<p>or use the <code>&lt;variables&gt;</code> section:</p>
<pre>&lt;variable
  name=&quot;polish.FullScreen&quot;
  value=&quot;false&quot; if=&quot;polish.blackberry || polish.android&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
<p>
	You can also add separators to the native menu by adding a <code>Command.SEPARATOR</code> command (the style is only used for other platforms):
</p>
<pre>
import de.enough.polish.ui.Command;
[...]
	
	//#style menuSeparator
	Command cmdSeparator = new Command("", Command.SEPARATOR, 5 );
	myScreen.addCommand( cmdSeparator );
</pre>

<h3 id="blackberry-gui-alerts">BlackBerry Alerts</h3>
<p>
You can instruct J2ME Polish so that it uses native BlackBerry alerts instead of ones rendered by J2ME Polish. This improves the integration into the 
BlackBerry platform and is a recommended setting in your <i>build.xml</i> script:
</p>
<pre>&lt;variable
  name=&quot;polish.useNativeAlerts&quot;
  value=&quot;true&quot; if=&quot;polish.blackberry || polish.android&quot; /&gt;
</pre>

<h2 id="blackberry-gui-platform">Platform Requests in J2ME Polish Applications</h2>
<p>
For enabling platform requests just sign your application. In the emulator you can also use the <code>MIDlet.platformRequest(String url)</code> call when you specify the
preprocessing variable <code>polish.BlackBerry.enablePlatformRequest</code> in your <i>build.xml</i> script:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.BlackBerry.enablePlatformRequest&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
</pre>

<h2 id="blackberry-native">Developing Native BlackBerry Applications</h2>
<p>
You can also develop native BlackBerry applications by defining the blackberry.main variable that contains the name of the class that extends net.rim.device.api.system.Application.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;variable name=&quot;blackberry.main&quot; value=&quot;com.company.product.ProductApplication&quot; /&gt;
</pre>

<h2 id="blackberry-ota">Deploying a BlackBerry Application Over The Air</h2>
<p>
The BlackBerry platform supports delivery of applications over the air (OTA).
These are the steps to get this kind of provisioning to work:

<ul>
  <li><a href="#blackberry-jar2cod">Create</a> a <i>.cod</i> file</li>
  <li>Unpack the <i>.cod</i> file. The 'outer' <i>.cod</i> file is a <i>.zip</i> file in disguise and you can unpack it
  with every unzip program available. Beware that the outer <i>.cod</i> file contains
  inner <i>.cod</i> files and that one inner <i>.cod</i> file has the same name as the outer
  <i>.cod</i> file. It is imperative that <em>every</em> inner <i>.cod</i> file is
  extracted, even if you need to overwrite the outer <i>.cod</i> file in the process.</li>
  <li>While building for a BlackBerry device, the created JAD file contains modified 
  URL safe entries. In case you require the original JAD file, use the <i>.jad.bak</i> one.
  The original <i>.jad</i> file which is generated from the rapc compiler contains
  entries of the form
   <code>RIM-COD-URL-1: BlackBerry$2d8100$2den_US$2dblank-1.cod</code>. Note the
   sequence <code>&quot;&#36;2d&quot;</code>. This should encode the charater
   <code>&quot;&#0045;&quot;</code> but the webserver will need the sequence
   <code>&quot;&#37;2d&quot;</code> to find the correct file. The file
   <i>.jad.alt.jad</i> contains corrected entries.</li>
   <li>Make all inner <i>.cod</i> files and the corrected <i>.jad</i> file
   available on a web server.
   The mimetype for the <i>.cod</i> file should be
   <code>application/vnd.rim.cod</code> and for the <i>.jad</i> file
   <code>text/vnd.sun.j2me.app-descriptor</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="blackberry-virtualdevices">Useful Virtual Devices</h2>
<p>
The J2ME Polish device database contains several virtual devices that you can target for limiting the number of BlackBerry builds.
Instead of building for BlackBerry/8100 and BlackBerry/8800 for example, you can generate one build for the virtual 
<code>BlackBerry/4.2TrackBall</code> device.
Note, however, that these virtual devices do not contain a screen size definition, so if you have resources that depend on the
screen resolution, you should target real devices instead.
<br />
Following virtual devices are available:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>BlackBerry/7.0</b>: for OS 7.0 devices</li>
	<li><b>BlackBerry/6.0</b>: for OS 6.0 devices</li>
	<li><b>BlackBerry/5.0</b>: for OS 5.0 devices</li>
	<li><b>BlackBerry/4.7</b>: for OS 4.7 devices (like the BlackBerry/Storm)</li>
	<li><b>BlackBerry/4.6</b>: for OS 4.6 devices like the BlackBerry Bold</li>
	<li><b>BlackBerry/4.5</b>: for OS 4.5 devices like the BlackBerry Curve</li>
	<li><b>BlackBerry/4.3</b>: for devices like the 8120, 8130 etc</li>
	<li><b>BlackBerry/4.2TrackBall</b>: for 4.2 devices with trackball like the 8100, 8800 etc</li>
	<li><b>BlackBerry/4.2</b>: for 4.2 devices without trackball</li>
	<li><b>BlackBerry/4.1</b>: for devices like the 8700, 7290 etc</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="blackberry-troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="blackberry-obfuscation">Deactivate Obfuscation</h3>
<p>
You should deactivate <a href="build-build.html#obfuscator">obfuscation</a> for BlackBerry devices, since the rapc compiler already removes any unneeded fields, classes etc. 
Also you can get verification errors on the BlackBerry devices when you enable the obfuscation. 
You can skip the obfuscation for test builds as well as for BlackBerry devices with this definition in your <i>build.xml</i> script:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;obfuscator name=&quot;ProGuard&quot; unless=&quot;test || polish.blackberry&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
<h3 id="blackberry-jadproperties">Rewriting JAD Properties</h3>
<p>
The BlackBerry tools do embedd application/JAD properties into the application during the build process. During OTA installation 
over the air, any rewritten or appended JAD properties will be ignored. You can consider building or converting the application
upon request for personalizing it.
</p>

<h3 id="blackberry-phonecalls">Phone Calls with DTMF</h3>
<p>
When using the J2ME Polish UI, you can send DTMF tones after initiating a phonecall by separating the MSISDN and the DTMF part with a 
backslash or a 'p':
</p>
<pre>
	myMidlet.platform.request(&quot;tel:001232878/88779&quot;);
	myMidlet.platform.request(&quot;tel:001232878p88779&quot;);
</pre>

<h3 id="blackberry-platformrequests">Platform Requests</h3>
<p>
For enabling platform requests using the <code>MIDlet.platformRequest(String url)</code> call, you need to sign your app or specify the
preprocessing variable <code>polish.BlackBerry.enablePlatformRequest</code> in your <i>build.xml</i> script:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.BlackBerry.enablePlatformRequest&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Note that this functionality requires a signed application on real devices.
</p>

<h3 id="blackberry-usinglcduiandpolish">Using Native High Level LCDUI Components</h3>
<p>
Normally you can mix native highlevel LCDUI components like <code>javax.microedition.lcdui.TextBox</code> with J2ME Polish
in your application by using fully qualified class names. This is not supported on BlackBerry devices, because the native BlackBerry
user interface API is used by J2ME Polish. On BlackBerry devices you cannot mix LCDUI components with BlackBerry user interface components
in the same application. Therefore you either either must not fully qualify native LCDUI components in your application or you
need to deactive the J2ME Polish UI for BlackBerry. 
<br />
Please note: In most cases you use a native <code>TextBox</code> so that the user can edit 
long texts - since J2ME Polish uses native <code>EditFields</code> on BlackBerry when a <code>TextField</code> is focused, there 
is no benefit in using a native <code>TextBox</code> anyhow.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.BlackBerry.mapSpaceToFire&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
