	<h1 id="top">CSS for J2ME</h1>
	<p>
J2ME Polish includes an optional Graphical User Interface, which can be designed using the 
web-standard Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). So every web-designer can now design mobile 
applications thanks to J2ME Polish! This chapter will explain all details of the design 
possibilities, no prior knowledge about CSS is required. The GUI is compatible with the 
javax.microedition.ui-classes, therefore no changes need to be made in the source code of 
the application. The GUI will be incorporated by the preprocessing mechanism automatically, 
unless the &quot;usePolishGui&quot;-attribute of the 
&lt;build&gt; element is set to false in the build.xml file.

All design settings and files are stored in the &quot;resources&quot; directory of the project, 
unless another directory has been specified. 
The most important file is polish.css in that directory. All design definitions can be found here. The design definitions are grouped in &quot;styles&quot;. A style can be assigned to any GUI item like a title, a paragraph or an input field. Within a style several attributes and its values are defined:
<pre>
.myStyle {
	font-color: white;
	font-style: bold;
	font-size: large;
	font-face: proportional;
	background-color: black;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example the style called &quot;myStyle&quot; defines some font values and the color of the background. Any style contains a selector as well as a number of attributes and its values:
</p>
<p>
Each attribute-value pair needs to be finished with a semicolon. The style declaration 
needs to be finished by a closing curved parenthesis. The selector or name of style is 
case-insensitive, so &quot;.MySTYle&quot; is the same as &quot;.myStyle&quot;.
Apart from the polish.css file, you can put images and other contents into the resources-folder. 
Sub-folders are used for styles and content for specific devices and groups. 
You can put all resources for Nokia devices into the &quot;Nokia&quot; folder and resources 
for Samsung's E700 into the &quot;Samsung/E700&quot; folder. 
This is described in more detail in the 
<a href="css-groups.html">&quot;Designing Specific Devices and Device-Groups&quot;</a> section.
</p><p>
You can specify styles directly for GUI items with the #style preprocessing directive in the 
source code. Alternatively you can use the dynamic names of the GUI items, e.g. 
&quot;p&quot; for text-items, &quot;a&quot; for hyperlinks or &quot;form p&quot; for all 
text-items which are embedded in a form. The possible combinations as well as the 
predefined style-names are discussed in the section 
<a href="css-styles.html">&quot;Dynamic, Static and Predefined Styles&quot;</a>.
</p><p>
Styles can extend other styles with the extends-keyword, e.g. &quot;.myStyle extends 
baseStyle {}&quot;. This process is described in the section 
<a href="css-extending.html">&quot;Extending Styles&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>
J2ME Polish supports the CSS box model with margins, paddings and content. Other common 
design settings include the background, the border and font-settings. These common
 settings are described in the section 
<a href="css-common.html">&quot;Common Design Attributes&quot;</a>.
</p><p>
Attributes for specific GUI items as well as the details of the different background and 
border types are discussed in the section 
<a href="css-specific.html">&quot;Specific Design Attributes&quot;</a>.
