	<h1 id="top">Device Optimization</h1>
	<%index %>
	<p>J2ME Polish includes a <a href="../devices-overview.html">device database</a> 
	which revolutionizes the way
	applications are optimized for specific devices.
	</p>
	<p>Programmers need to create only standards compliant
	J2ME applications. J2ME Polish optimizes this code and incorporates
	device specific APIs to deliver the best possible user experience. 
	Designers can easily adjust and change designs for specific devices
	or device-groups, just by organizing the appropriate resources into
	<a href="resource-assembling.html">folders</a>.
	</p>
	<h2 id="manual">Manual Optimization</h2>
	<p>Manual device optimization is made easy with the device database and
	the powerful <a href="preprocessing.html">preprocessing</a> capabilities. Just consider
	   the following examples:</p>
<p>Checking if a device supports an API:
<pre>
//#if polish.api.mmapi
	import javax.microedition.media.*;
//#endif
</pre>
</p>
<p>Checking how many colors a device supports:
<pre>
//#if polish.BitsPerPixel >= 8
	// okay this device supports at least 2^8= 256 colors
//#endif
</pre>
</p>
<p>Combining both examples:
<pre>
//#if polish.api.mmapi && (polish.BitsPerPixel >= 8)
	// okay this device supports at least 2^8= 256 colors 
	// and supports the Mobile Media API
//#endif
</pre>
</p>
<p>Checking for a specific vendor:
<pre>
//#if polish.Vendor == Nokia
	// this device is by Nokia
//#endif
</pre>
</p>
<p>Checking for the MIDP platform:
<pre>
//#if polish.midp1
	// this device supports the MIDP/1.0 platform
//#elif polish.midp2
	// this device supports the MIDP/2.0 platform
//#endif
</pre>
</p>
<p>Extending a full-screen-class, but only when the device supports this:
<pre>
public class MyCanvas
//#if polish.useFullScreen && polish.classes.fullscreen:defined
	//#= extends ${polish.classes.fullscreen}
//#else
	extends Canvas
//#endif
</pre>
</p>

	<h2 id="database">Device Database</h2>
	<p>J2ME Polish includes a <a href="../devices-overview.html">device database</a> 
	in which the capabilities
	of the known devices are defined.
	The device-definitions are stored in following files:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>devices.xml: main file for the devices.</li>
		<li>groups.xml: definition of the device-groups.</li>
		<li>vendors.xml: definition of the device vendors.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These files can be extended easiliy to incorporate new devices. 
	The structure of theses files is documented in the (almost)
	<a href="../downloads/Complete_Guide_to_J2ME_Polish.pdf">Complete Guide to J2ME Polish</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="resources">Resource Assembling</h2>
	<p>It is easy to assemble resources for specific devices or device-groups.
	How this is done is described in the <a href="resource-assembling.html">assembling resources</a>-documentation
	and in the <a href="css-groups.html">designing for specific devices</a>-documentation.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="automatic">Automatic Optimization</h2>
	<p>Most optimization tasks are needed for the user interface
	of an application. The <a href="css.html">J2ME Polish GUI</a> adjusts automatically
	to the specific capabilities of a device and removes the need
	for work-intensive manual optimization.</p>
