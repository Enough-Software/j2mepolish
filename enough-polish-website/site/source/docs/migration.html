	<p>
	Some aspects of J2ME Polish have been changed since J2ME Polish 1.x. On this page you will learn about the necessary changes
	to your build.xml scripts and polish.css design files.
	</p>
<h2 id="taskdefinition">Task Definition</h2>
<p>
In J2ME Polish 2.0 the <i>enough-j2mepolish-build.jar</i> moved from the <i>import</i> to the <i>lib</i> folder, so any task definitions
within build.xml scripts have to be changed:
	<pre>
&lt;taskdef 
	name=&quot;j2mepolish&quot; 
	classname=&quot;de.enough.polish.ant.PolishTask&quot; 
	classpath=&quot;${polish.home}/lib/enough-j2mepolish-build.jar
		:${polish.home}/lib/jdom.jar&quot; /&gt;
	</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
	We've done this change so that programmers can better distinguish between libraries that are only used during build time and libraries that
	are available on the phones (like the MMAPI for example) and that programmers would like to add to the classpath of their projects.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="screenmargins">Screen Margins</h2>
	<p>
	In J2ME Polish 1.x <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code> CSS attributes both resulted in the same space between the physycal border
	of a screen and its content. In J2ME Polish 2.0 margins produce actual margins between the physical border of a screen and the screen's background.
	This can be used for creating popup screens for example. So if there are now gaps showing in an application's screen, just use <code>padding</code> 
	instead of <code>margin</code> for the respective screen's style in the <i>polish.css</i> file.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="rightcommandlayout">Layout of the Right Command</h2>
	<p>
	When using the <a href="gui-screenelement-menubar.html">extended menubar</a> the default layout of the <code>rightcommand</code> CSS style
	has been changed from <code>right</code> to the item's default layout (<code>left</code>). This change allows us to realize layouts like 
	<code>center</code> which have been not possible in J2ME Polish 1.x.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="license">License Key</h2>
	<p>
	In J2ME Polish 1.x the <code>license</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;info&gt;</code> element described the used J2ME Polish license. This element
	is not supported anymore and is ignored. Existing J2ME Polish 1.x customers can upgrade to 2.x, please inquire for details by sending a query 
	to j2mepolish(at)enough(dot)de.
