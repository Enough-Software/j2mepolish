	<p>For installing J2ME Polish <a href="../download.html">download</a> the
	latest release and start the installation either by double-clicking the file or
	by calling &quot;java -jar j2mepolish-<%= PolishVersion %>.jar&quot; from the command-line.
	<br/>
	The installer of J2ME Polish contains a sample MIDlet application with
	two different designs. This application is optimized for Nokia Series
	60 devices, so it is recommended to have such an emulator installed. The
	Nokia emulator can be retrieved from <a href="http://forum.nokia.com">http://forum.nokia.com</a>.
	<br/>
	To build the sample application, run the included &quot;sample/build.xml&quot; from your
	favorite Java IDE or call &quot;ant&quot; from the command-line, after you have
	switched to the &quot;sample&quot; directory. Call
	&quot;ant test j2mepolish&quot; to skip the obfuscation and to enable the
	logging of the sample application. In that case the default emulator
	is also launched by J2ME Polish.

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements for Installing J2ME Polish</h2>
<p>
To use J2ME Polish, following components need to be installed:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Java 2 Standard Edition SDK 1.4  or higher, 
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/" target="_blank">http://java.sun.com/j2se/</a>
	</li>
	<li>Sun Java Wireless Toolkit, 
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/index.html" target="_blank">http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/index.html</a> (for Windows and Linux),
	<br/>
	or the Mobile Power Player SDK <a href="http://developer.mpowerplayer.com/" target="_blank">http://developer.mpowerplayer.com</a> (for Mac OS X)	
	</li>
	<li>Favorite IDE, for example Eclipse 3.0, 
	<a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">http://www.eclipse.org</a>
	</li>
	<li>Ant 1.6 or higher, if not already integrated in the IDE, 
	<a href="http://ant.apache.org" target="_blank">http://ant.apache.org</a>
	</li>
	<li>Optionally device emulators, e.g. the Nokia J2ME emulator, 
	<a href="http://forum.nokia.com" target="_blank">http://forum.nokia.com</a>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="problems">Installation Problems</h2>
<p>
Here are common problems that might occur during the installation:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>ZIP instead of JAR</b>: some versions of Internet Explorer rename the extension of installer from <code>.jar</code> to <code>.zip</code>. In that case please rename the extension before starting the installation.</li>
   <li><b>All files are extracted</b>: sometimes a decompression utility feels responsible for <code>.jar</code> files. In that case either right-click the installer and choose to open it with Java or call the installer from the commandline using <code>java -jar j2mepolish-${version}.jar</code>, where ${version} denotes the current version number.</li>
   <li><b>Where is the source?</b> During the installation you have to actively select to install the sources within the package selection. Afterwards you will find the source in <i>${polish.home}/source</i>.</li>
   <li><b>Where is the devices.xml?</b> Like the sources you have to actively select to install the device database during the installation. We recommend visiting <a href="http://devices.j2mepolish.org">http://devices.j2mepolish.org</a> instead.</li>
</ul>
