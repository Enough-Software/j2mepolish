	<p>
		Enter the name of your existing project.
	</p>

	<p>
		Alter the paths you want to use in this project. At least WTK Home and J2ME Polish Home must be set.
	</p>

	<p>
		Select the devices you want to support with this project. Currently you need to convert a J2ME Polish project again for changing the target devices.
	</p>

	<p>
		Alter the Java settings if you like. You need to adjust the source setting when you have not stored you Jasva source code files within the &quot;source/src&quot; folder. Note that all possible jars for the selected devices are already included in the project.
	</p>

	<p>
		Click "Finish" to convert the project. If you already had a build.xml script, that script will be backed up and replaced by a J2ME Polish/Mepose specific script. Please copy any settings over to the new script, as Mepose relies on the given target names and property loading mechanisms.
