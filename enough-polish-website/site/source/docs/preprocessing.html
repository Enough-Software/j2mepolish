	<%index %>
<p>
Preprocessing changes the source code before it is compiled. With this mechanism any 
device optimization can be done easily. An example is the inclusion of the J2ME&nbsp;Polish GUI, 
which is &quot;weaved&quot; into the application by the build-process without any intervention of the developer.
Most preprocessing is triggered by directives, which use either symbols or variables. 
A symbol is like a boolean value - either it is defined or the symbol is not defined. 
A variable, however, always contains a value, which can be used or compared during the 
preprocessing.<br/>
Symbols and variables are defined in several files:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>build.xml: with the &quot;symbols&quot;-attribute of the &lt;build&gt; element and with the &lt;variables&gt; element</li>
 <li>vendors.xml, groups.xml, devices.xml: symbols are defined by the &lt;features&gt; element, whereas variables are defined by the capabilities. Most capabilities also define symbols.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to the integrated <a href="http://devices.j2mepolish.org">device database</a>,
J2ME Polish supports a lot of useful <a href="preprocessing-variables.html">symbols and variables</a>, 
with which device optimizations are easier than ever.</p>
<p>
Preprocessing <a href="preprocessing-directives.html">directives</a> always start 
with a <code>&quot;//#&quot;</code> and often have one or more 
arguments. All directives must not span several rows. 
J2ME&nbsp;Polish supports all directives (and more) of the antenna preprocessor (antenna.sourceforge.net), 
by the way. So if you migrate from antenna, you can keep your preprocessing directives.
