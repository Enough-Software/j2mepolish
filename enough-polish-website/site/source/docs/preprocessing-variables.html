	<h1 id="preprocessing-top">Variables and Symbols</h1>
	<%index %>
<p>
Most preprocessing is triggered by directives, which use either symbols or variables. 
A symbol is like a boolean value - either it is defined or the symbol is not defined. 
A variable, however, always contains a value, which can be used or compared during the 
preprocessing.<br/>
Symbols and variables are defined in several files:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>build.xml: with the &quot;symbols&quot;-attribute of the &lt;build&gt; element and with the &lt;variables&gt; element</li>
 <li>vendors.xml, groups.xml, devices.xml: symbols are defined by the &lt;features&gt; element, whereas variables are defined by the capabilities. Most capabilities also define symbols.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to the integrated <a href="../devices-overview.html">device database</a>,
J2ME Polish supports a lot of useful symbols and variables, with which device
optimizations are easier than ever.</p>

	 floating point calculations, we recommend to check for the &quot;polish.hasFloatingPoint&quot; instead of &quot;polish.cldc1.1&quot;,
	 because in this way you can use the <a href="floater.html">Floater</a> tool.
