	<table class="borderedTable"  cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1">
	<tr><th>info-Attribute&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><th>Required&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
	<tr><td>name</td>
 	 <td>Yes</td>
	 <td>The name of the project, the variable &quot;MIDlet-Name&quot; overrides this setting. This variable can be used to localize the application.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>version</td>
 	 <td>Yes</td>
	 <td>The version of the project in the format [major].[minor].[build]. Example: <code>version="2.1.10".</code> The variable &quot;MIDlet-Version&quot; overrides this setting.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>description</td>
 	 <td>Yes</td>
	 <td>The description of the project. A brief explanation about what this application does should be given here. The variable &quot;MIDlet-Description&quot; overrides the value given here, this van be used to localize the application.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>vendorName</td>
 	 <td>Yes</td>
	 <td>The name of the vendor of this application. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>jarName</td>
 	 <td>Yes</td>
	 <td>The name of the jar-files which will be created. You can use all J2ME Polish variables as in every other attribute,
	 but the following are especially useful:
	 <br/><code>${polish.vendor}</code>: The vendor of the device, e.g. Samsung or Motorola
	 <br/><code>${polish.name}</code>: The name of the device
	 <br/><code>${polish.identifier}</code>: Vendor and device name, e.g.  &quot;Nokia/N95&quot;
	 <br/><code>${polish.version}</code>: The version of the project as defined above.
	 <br/><code>${polish.language}</code>: The two letter ISO language-code, e.g. &quot;en&quot; or &quot;de&quot;.
	 <br/><code>${polish.country}</code>: The two letter ISO country-code, e.g. &quot;US&quot; or &quot;DE&quot;. This can be empty when no country is defined in the current locale.
	 <br/><code>${polish.locale}</code>: The current locale, e.g. &quot;en&quot; or &quot;de_DE&quot;.	 
	 <br/>Example: 
	 <code>jarName=&quot;Game-${polish.vendor}-
	 ${polish.name}-${polish.locale}.jar&quot;</code> 
	 results into &quot;Game-Nokia-6600-en.jar&quot; for an application which has been optimized for the Nokia/N95 
	 and uses the English locale.

	</tr>
	<tr><td>jarUrl</td>
 	 <td>Yes</td>
	 <td>The URL from which the jar file can be downloaded. This is either the HTTP address, or just the name of the jar-file, when it is loaded locally. Apart from the variables available for the jarName-attribute, you can use the name of the jar-file as defined above:
 	  <br/>
	  <code>jarUrl=&quot;http://www.enough.de/midlets/Game/
	  ${polish.vendor}/${polish.name}/${polish.jarName}&quot;</code>
	 </td>

	<tr><td>deleteConfirm</td>
 	 <td>No</td>
	 <td>The text which is presented to the user when he tries to delete the application. The variable &quot;MIDlet-Delete-Confirm&quot; overrides this setting, this van be used to localize the application.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>installNotify</td>
 	 <td>No</td>
	 <td>A HTTP-URL, which should be called after the successful installation of the application.. This can be useful for tracking how many applications are installed, for example. The user can prevent the install-notify, though. One can use the same variables as for the jarUrl-attribute. The variable &quot;MIDlet-Install-Notify&quot; overrides this setting.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>deleteNotify</td>
 	 <td>No</td>
	 <td>A HTTP-URL, which should be called after the application has been deleted from the device. See the explanation of installNotify. The variable &quot;MIDlet-Delete-Notify&quot; overrides this setting.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>dataSize</td>
 	 <td>No</td>
	 <td>The minimum space which is needed on the device, e.g. <br/><code>dataSize=&quot;120kb&quot;</code>. The variable &quot;MIDlet-Data-Size&quot; overrides this setting.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>permissions</td>
 	 <td>No</td>
	 <td>The permissions which are needed by this application, e.g. <br/><code>permissions=&quot;javax.microedition.io.Connector.http&quot;</code>. The variable &quot;MIDlet-Permissions&quot; overrides this setting.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>optionalPermissions</td>
 	 <td>No</td>
	 <td>The permissions which are useful for this application, e.g. <br/><code>optionalPermissions=&quot;javax.microedition.io.Connector.http&quot;</code>. The variable &quot;MIDlet-Permissions-Opt&quot; overrides this setting.</td>

	<tr><td>profile</td>
 	 <td>No</td>
	 <td>Normally J2ME Polish is using the JavaPlatform capability of the current target device for determining the correct &quot;MicroEdition-Profile&quot; setting.

This is useful only in cases, when you determine device capabilities during the runtime of the application and want to deliver one application bundle for all target devices.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>configuration</td>
 	 <td>No</td>
	 <td>Normally J2ME Polish is using the JavaConfiguration capability of the current target device for determining the correct &quot;MicroEdition-Configuration&quot; setting. You can override this by hardcoding the configuration for all target devices.
