	<h1 id="top">Logging</h1>
	<p class="pullquote">
	Logging can be essential for tracking down errors. The J2ME Polish log system is optimized for mobile usage
	and provides real world solutions for typical requirements.
	</p>
	
<p>
	With J2ME Polish you can selectively activate and deactivate logging levels
	for specific classes and packages. Log data is printed out to the system's output by default, but you can add
	further log handlers for storing data to the record management system, sending log entries to your remote
	server or even realize your own log handlers.
	<br />
	And best of all: you can deactivate all logging traces completely from your application once it is ready
	for deployment.
</p>
<p>
	Main features include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Activate or deactivate log levels like debug, info, warn, error for single classes or packages. </li>
  <li>Use your own log levels.</li>
  <li>View log messages on real devices as well.</li>
  <li>When log messages are not active, they will not be compiled and use, therefore, no resources at all.</li>
  <li>The complete logging can be deactivated.</li>
  <li>Simple <code>System.out.println()</code> calls are used for logging.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="logging-programming">Log with #debug</h2>
<p>
<!-- 
To include debugging information in a J2ME application is not without problems. 
The main problem is that any debugging slows down an application unnecessarily. 
Another problem is that nobody wants the debugging information in an application 
which should be deployed &quot;in the wild&quot;. With J2ME&nbsp;Polish debugging statements 
can be included into the applications without having the above disadvantages. 
 -->
Use the <code>#debug</code> directive to log some debugging information:
</p>
<pre>
//#debug
System.out.println("debugging is enabled for this class.");
</pre>
<p>
You can define what debugging level is used by adding the log level to  the <code>#debug</code> directive. When no level is specified the <code>debug</code> level is assumed.
</p>
<pre>
//#debug info
System.out.println("the info debugging level is enabled for this class.");
</pre>
<p>
Use the <code>#mdebug</code> (multi-line debug) directive to add multiple lines of debugging information. 
Mark the end of such sections with the <code>#enddebug</code> directive:
</p>
<pre>
//#mdebug error
e.printStackTrace();
System.out.println("unable to load something: " + e.getMessage() );
//#enddebug
</pre>
<table class="borderedTable"  cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1">
	<tr><th>Directive&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
	<tr><td>//#debug [level]</td>
	 <td>The next line is only compiled when the debugging setting for the class in which the debugging information is enabled for the specified level. When no level is specified, the &quot;debug&quot; level is assumed.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>//#mdebug [level]</td>
	 <td>The next lines up to the #enddebug directive will be compiled only when the debugging setting for the class in which the debugging information is enabled for the specified level. When no level is specified, the &quot;debug&quot; level is assumed.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>//#enddebug</td>
	 <td>Marks the end of the #mdebug section.</td>
</table>

<h3 id="levels">Debug Levels</h3>
<p>
Following debug levels are predefined:
&quot;debug&quot;, &quot;info&quot;, &quot;warn&quot;, &quot;error&quot; and &quot;fatal&quot;. The specific level for a class can be defined with the <debug> element of the J2ME&nbsp;Polish-task:
<pre>
&lt;debug showLogOnError=&quot;true&quot; verbose=&quot;false&quot; level=&quot;error&quot; if=&quot;test&quot;  &gt;
	&lt;filter pattern=&quot;com.company.package.*&quot; level=&quot;info&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;filter pattern=&quot;com.company.package.MyClass&quot; level=&quot;debug&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/debug&gt;
</pre></p><p>
Please see the section <a href="build-build.html#debug">&lt;debug&gt;</a> for further information. The levels are weighted, meaning that the debug level is lower than the info level, which is in turn lower than the error level and so forth:
<pre>
debug &lt; info &lt; warn &lt; error &lt; fatal &lt; user-defined
</pre></p><p>
Thus when the info level is activated for a class, all debugging information with the level &quot;warn&quot;, &quot;error&quot;, &quot;fatal&quot; and with a user-defined level will also be compiled. 
User specific debugging levels can be useful for accomplishing specific tasks. For example a level &quot;benchmark&quot; could be defined to allow the measurement of the performance:
<pre>
//#debug benchmark
long startTime = System.currentTimeMilis();
callComplexMethod();
//#debug benchmark
System.out.println("complex method took [" + (System.currentTimeMilis() - startTime) + "] ms.");
</pre></p>
