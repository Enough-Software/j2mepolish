<h1 id="top">Developing for Windows Mobile Devices</h1>
<p>
With J2ME Polish you can either create Java ME applications for Windows Mobile (tm) handsets or convert your application into a native 
Windows Mobile executable.
</p>
<h2 id="windowsmobile-javeme">Creating Java Applications For Windows Mobile</h2>
<p>
You can create your application for Windows Mobile devices with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) normally like for any other 
device. If you want to create a generic version for all Windows Mobile phones you can target the <i>Native/WindowsMobile</i> phone
in your <a href="build-deviceRequirements.html">&lt;deviceRequirements&gt;</a> section.
</p>
<p>
Since there are different JVMs available for Windows Mobile, J2ME Polish cannot create device optimized versions for some of the
device features like soft key values. We recommend, therefore, to turn off the rendering of the commands menu and the direct input mode 
of TextFields for Windows Mobile devices by specifying some conditional <a href="build-build.html#variables">variables</a> in your
<i>build.xml</i> file:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.FullScreen&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; if=&quot;${ isOS( Windows ) }&quot; /&gt;
&lt;variable name=&quot;polish.TextField.useDirectInput&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; unless=&quot;polish.hasPointerEvents or isOS(Windows)&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Note that some Java Virtual Machines/MIDlet Managers require an absolute <code>MIDlet-Jar-URL</code> within
the JAD file so that the application can be installed correctly via OTA.
</p>

<h3 id="windowsmobile-native-abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>
Running Java applications on Windows MobileTM platforms provides a suboptimal user 
experience. For ensuring a seamless integration into the Windows Mobile environment, best 
performance  and an optimal user experience, a native application is necessary. 
The J2ME PolishTM Native Windows Mobile Extensions translate mobile Java applications into 
native executables that require no installed Java Virtual Machine and run with a blazingly fast 
graphics support. This allows you to leverage existing mobile Java applications and port them 
unmodified and fully automated to native Windows Mobile applications. 
</p>
<h3 id="windowsmobile-native-motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>
Running mobile Java applications on Windows Mobile platforms is possible, but it has various 
drawbacks: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The user needs to purchase and install a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Sometimes this is 
done by the carrier or the device manufacturer as well.</li>
	<li>There are various JVMs available for Windows Mobile, so you cannot know which JVM 
your user has installed. This means that you cannot optimize your application for a 
specific JVM. Softbuttons, which are not defined within the mobile Java standard, are 
mapped to different keys, for example.</li>
	<li>Most JVMs do not support all options for lowlevel LCDUI usage - often keys like the 
typical &quot;back/delete&quot; key do not trigger events but close the application without allowing 
the programmer to prevent this.</li>
	<li>Often the performance of JVMs results in considerably slower applications than native ones.</li>
	<li>You can launch Java applications only by first launching the MIDlet Manager of the 
installed JVM. Your application is not a first class citizen available directly within the 
start menu.</li>
	<li>Last but not least you also need to launch the MIDlet Manager for deinstalling your 
application.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These reasons accumulate to a poor user experience for mobile Java applications on Windows 
Mobile phones.
</p>

<h3 id="windowsmobile-native-technology">Porting Technology</h3>
<p>
The automated porting is realized by transcoding your Java source code into C# source code. It 
is then compiled and linked with a MIDP wrapper API. This optimized wrapper provides mobile 
Java functionality to Windows Mobile applications and uses high performance graphics, which is 
even faster than the graphics of the .NET Compact Framework. The complete application is 
than bundled into a CAB installer. This also allows your users to install the application using 
Microsoft's Active Sync/Windows Mobile Device Center(tm).
</p>

<h3 id="windowsmobile-native-javatech">Supported Java Technologies</h3>
<p>
You can access the full MIDP 2.0 functionality set with our native Windows Mobile technology 
with the exception of high level user interface components like Form or List. We recommend 
the usage of the low level user interface API or using the J2ME Polish UI for realizing your user 
interface. 
<br />
Adding support for further libraries is possible.
</p>

<h3 id="windowsmobile-native-wmtech">Accessing Advanced Windows Mobile APIs From Within Java Applications</h3>
<p>
You can access all functions of the .NET Compact Framework from within your Java application. 
A corresponding Java library is delivered as part of the porter. 
</p>
