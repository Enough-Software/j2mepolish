<h1 id="top">Integrating a Custom Obfuscator</h1>
<%index %>
<p>
For integrating another obfuscator, you need to first create a class which extends the 
<a href="<%= javadocdir %>../javadoc/build/de/enough/polish/obfuscate/Obfuscator.html" target="_blank">de.enough.polish.obfuscate.Obfuscator</a> class. Secondly you need to integrate your 
obfuscator in the &quot;build.xml&quot; file.
</p>

<h2 id="preparations">Preparations</h2>
<p>
Create a new project in your IDE and set the classpath so that it includes the &quot;enough-j2mepolish-build.jar&quot;, which can be found in the &quot;import&quot; folder of the installation directory. Also include the &quot;ant.jar&quot; file from your Ant-installation into the classpath.
</p>
<h2 id="creating">Creating the Obfuscator Class</h2>
<p>
Create a new class which extends 
<a href="<%= javadocdir %>../javadoc/build/de/enough/polish/obfuscate/Obfuscator.html" target="_blank">de.enough.polish.obfuscate.Obfuscator</a>
 and implement the &quot;obfuscate&quot; method:
<pre>
	/**
	 * Obfuscates a jar-file for the given device.
	 * 
	 * @param device The J2ME device
	 * @param sourceFile The jar-file containing the projects classes
	 * @param targetFile The file to which the obfuscated classes should be copied to 
	 * @param preserve All names of classes which should be preserved,
	 *                 that means not renamed or removed.
	 * @param bootClassPath A path to the library containing either the MIDP/1.0
 	 *                 or MIDP/2.0 environment.
	 * @throws BuildException when the obfuscation failed
	 */
	public abstract void obfuscate( 	Device device, 
						File sourceFile, 
						File targetFile, 
						String[] preserve, 
						Path bootClassPath )
	throws BuildException;
</pre></p>
<p>
You can make use of following protected variables:</p>
<ul>
	<li>de.enough.polish.LibraryManager libraryManager: a manager for device-APIs</li>
	<li>java.io.File libDir: the path to the &quot;import&quot; folder</li>
	<li>org.apache.tools.ant.Project project: the Ant project in which the obfuscator is embedded</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
If you need further configuration settings, you can add them with the &lt;parameter&gt; construct, which is discussed below.
<p>
To call the obfuscator, you typically need to accomplish these tasks in the &quot;obfuscate&quot;-method:
<p>
<ol>
	<li>Set the classpath for the given device: You can get the device-specific APIs by calling device.getClasspath() which returns a String array containing the locations of the device-API-Jars. The usual behavior is to set the classpath for the obfuscator to the given bootClassPath and the device-specific APIs.</li>
	<li>Specify which classes should be spared from obfuscation: the classes specified by the preserve-array should not be obfuscated at all. These always include the MIDlet classes and maybe some other classes which are loaded with the Class.forName()-mechanism.</li>
	<li>Start the obfuscator: set the input to the provided sourceFile and the output to the specified targetFile. Both of these files are Jars.tart the obfuscator: set the input to the provided sourceFile and the output to the specified targetFile. Both of these files are Jars.</li>
</ol>
<p>
When there is an exception, abort the build by throwing a org.apache.tools.ant.BuildException explaining the details why the obfuscation was aborted.
</p>

<h2 id="integrate">Integrating the Obfuscator into the build.xml</h2>
<p></p>
You can integrate any thirdparty obfuscator with the usual &lt;obfuscator&gt; element in 
the build.xml file 
(compare the <a href="build-build.html#obfuscator">&lt;obfuscator&gt; documentation</a>).
<pre>
&lt;obfuscator unless=&quot;test&quot; enable=&quot;true&quot; 	
	class=&quot;com.company.obfuscate.MyObfuscator&quot;
	classPath=&quot;../obfuscator-project/bin/classes&quot;
	&gt;
	&lt;keep class=&quot;com.company.dynamic.SomeDynamicClass&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;keep class=&quot;com.company.dynamic.AnotherDynamicClass&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;parameter name=&quot;scriptFile&quot; value=&quot;../scripts/obfuscate.script&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/obfuscator&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
The &quot;class&quot;-attribute needs to be set to the new class. The classPath-attribute can be used for pointing out the location of the obfuscator. This is only needed when the obfuscator is not on the Ant-classpath.
</p>
<h2 id="parameters">Configuring the Obfuscator with Parameters</h2>
<p>
The obfuscator can be configured using &lt;parameter&gt; subelements in the build.xml. For each &lt;parameter&gt; a corresponding 
&quot;set[parameter-name]&quot;-method needs to be implemented, which either needs to have one File parameter, one boolean or one String parameter:
<pre>
	&lt;parameter name=&quot;scriptFile&quot; value=&quot;../scripts/obfuscate.script&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
For the using the above parameter, the obfuscator needs to implement either the 
public method <code>setScriptFile( File file )</code> or the public method 
<code>setScriptFile( String value )</code>. When a method with a File-parameter is used, relative file paths are resolved relative to the location of the build.xml file (or to be more precise relative to the project.getBaseDir() location). The file given as a parameter in the set-method uses an absolute path in that case.
