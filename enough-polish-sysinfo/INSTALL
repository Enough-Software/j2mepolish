How to Build the SysInfo-MIDlet
===============================

From the command-line:
go into this directory and call "ant".

From any IDE:
rightclick the "build.xml" file and select "Run > Ant", "Execute" or similar.

You will find the generated JAR und JAD file in the "dist" folder.

Note that you will need J2ME Polish for building the MIDlet - see http://www.j2mepolish.org
