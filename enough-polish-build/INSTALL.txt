********************
*** Requirements ***
********************

To use J2ME Polish, following components need to be installed:

Java 2 Standard Edition SDK 1.4  or higher, http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/index.jsp

Java Wireless Toolkit, http://java.sun.com/products/j2mewtoolkit/index.html 

Favorite IDE, for example Eclipse 3.0, http://www.eclipse.org 

Ant 1.5 or higher, if not already integrated in the IDE, http://ant.apache.org


***********************************
*** Installation of J2ME Polish ***
***********************************

Following components need to be installed:

The build tools (enough-j2mepolish-build.jar, jdom.jar, and proguard.jar or retroguard.jar).

Optionally the J2ME utilities and GUI classes, when the GUI or the utilities should be 
used directly in the project (enough-j2mepolish-client.jar).

Just follow these steps:

1. Extract the file j2mepolish.zip from the "setup"-folder of your installation CD 
   or from www.j2mepolish.org/download.html into your application project 
   (the project for which you want to use J2MEÂ Polish).

2. You now need to adjust the build.xml file, which you can find in the 
   root of your project. To check out the example, please adjust
   the "wtk.home"-property which is situated at the beginning fo the build.xml
   file.
  
3. A designer needs to adjust the file resources/polish.css for your project. 
   To check out the example, no settings need to be changed.

4. If you want to use the J2ME utilities or the J2ME Polish GUI directly, 
   add the file import/enough-j2mepolish-client.jar to the classpath of your project.

5. Call Ant from the command line or from within your IDE.

6. You will find the created JARs and JADs within the "dist" folder of
   the project.

Congratulations, you have managed the installation!

*** Integrating J2ME Polish into Eclipse ***
********************************************

To integrate J2ME Polish into Eclipse it is best to create a new folder in your workspace 
called "myproject" (or any other name) and to extract the J2ME Polish zip file into it. 
Then go into Eclipse and create a new project called "myproject". Eclipse should then 
integrate all source-files automatically. 


You now need to adjust the classpath of the new project: 
Select the project, right click, select "properties" and go to the "Java Build Path". 
Go to the "Libraries" tab -> "Add Jars..." and include the library 
"workspace/myproject/import/midp2.jar". 


Now open the file "build.xml" (which is located in the root of your project) and 
adjust the "wtk.home"-property in it. This is located at the very beginning of the 
build.xml file. 
The build.xml file has Unix style line endings, so if you have trouble reading this 
file, either open it in Eclipse or open it with a real text-editor (read: not Notepad!). 
You can also change the deviceRequirements if you want to. The example is optimized to 
Nokia Series 60 devices. 


You can now create the JAR and JAD files by right-clicking the build.xml file, selecting 
"Run Ant" and running Ant in the next dialog. You will find the JAR and JAD files then 
in the "dist" folder of the project. If you want to access them from within Eclipse, 
you might need to refresh your project: 
Right-click the project and select "Refresh".
