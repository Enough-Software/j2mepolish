<!-- 
	Use custom-extensions.xml for defining your own extensions.
	This is not needed, but simplifies the usage of your own
	extensions, e.g. resource copier, property functions, log handlers and
	so on.
	
	Each extension needs to have at least a name, a type and a class.
	You can use any name for your extension, as long as it is unique for
	the type. Types are simple (lowercase) strings and are specific to your
	extension type, e.g. resourcecopier, loghandler or propertyfunction.
	
	You can also set a classpath that can contain Ant and J2ME Polish properties.
	
	Depending on the extensions you may also add other specific elements.
	
	An example for a property function is this:
	
	
	<extension>
		<type>propertyfunction</type>
		<name>sha512</name>
		<class>com.company.crypto.SHA512</class>
		<classpath>${polish.home}/import/crypto.jar</classpath>
	</extension>
	
	You could now use this property function like this:
	
	//#= String msisdnHash = "${ sha512( user.msisdn ) }";
	
	(This example assumes that you are building the application on demand
	for each user)
