* Errors that are produced by user action should result in message dialog!
  (Main/Swt/WebStart)

* Open URL dialog should have Editable DropDown instead of Input box.
  There should be the list of recently opened URLS this list should
  be stored in config.xml

* Need SWT, Swing done - In File dialog we need to have recently opened files. Add the list  to config.xml

* Midlet display window should have the ability to have magnified version.

* persistent RecordStore for applet using cookies (some code already exist written by Roar Lauritzsen)

* extended web site with overview, api docs, faq section, instalation instructions, etc.
  (app requires Java 2, applet can be run in JVM 1.1)

* Prepare WebStart environment to be part of standard distribution not just our demo.

* Untrusted webstart

* decide what to do with JSObject.  create stub class  or use  USER_LIBRARY in .classpath ro eclipse.

* JUnit / HeadlessEmulator

* rebuild InputMethod to extend functionality:
  - switching between modes (numeric, password, URL, etc.)
  - solve problem with VK_BACKSPACE key on emulator device

* ConnectionFramework
  - udp
  - file  in memory

* (?) applet loader - during loading applet code progress bar should be visible

* Replace all System.err.println with proper log infrastructure

* Create eclipseme.core.model.impl for Microemulator as described
  http://eclipseme.org/docs/developer/extending.html
  Contribute this to eclipseme

* UEI
