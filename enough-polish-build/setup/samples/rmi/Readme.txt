*** RMI Sample Application
****************************************************

This application shows how easily you can call server side code with the Remote Method Invocation (RMI) framework of J2ME Polish.

Please build first the application by calling either the "j2mepolish", "emulator" or the "build-all" Ant target, 
then create the server side code by calling "deploy-war", which will place a generated WAR file into ${webapps.home}.

Check out the build.xml script and the source code for details. You can find more informatin about the RMI framework on www.j2mepolish.org.

Have fun!
