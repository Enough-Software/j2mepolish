<h1>The J2ME Polish API documentation</h1>
<p>The API of J2ME Polish is split between the build-tool and the J2ME API:
<br/><a href="javadoc/build/index.html">API of the build-tool</a>
<br/><a href="javadoc/j2me/index.html">Documentation of the J2ME API</a>
</p>
<p>This documentation is useful if you want to adjust or extend the 
J2ME Polish tool itself. If you want to use J2ME Polish, have a look at the other
documentations.
