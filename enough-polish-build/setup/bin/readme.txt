This folder contains some additional tools
for J2ME development.

The binary editor can be used for editing any kind 
of structured binary data, e.g. level-data.
Start the editor and open the "level.definition" and
the data-file "level1.data" for an example. The editor 
can also generate code for loading the data in your
application: select "Code" -> "Generate Code".

The font editor can be used to transform any true type 
(ttf) font into the bitmap-font-format of J2ME Polish (bmf). 
Such fonts can then be used via CSS or with the 
de.enough.polish.tools.BitMapFont class.

If you want to let J2ME Polish automatically resolve
stack-traces, please install the "jad" decompiler either
in this folder or on your PATH. The "jad" decompiler can be 
downloaded free of charge at http://www.kpdus.com/jad.html.
