Please copy all jar-files into the "import"-folder of your J2ME installation directory (${polish.home}/import).
Copy all XML files to ${polish.home}, but skip the custom-xxx.xml files when you have adjusted them yourself.

The provided "build.xml" needs to be adjusted:
- the "wtk.home" property needs to point to the installation directory of
  the Wireless Toolkit.
- the "polish.home" property needs to point to the installation directory of
  J2ME Polish.
- the "license" attribute of the <build>-elements needs to be either "GPL" or
  the commercial license key.
