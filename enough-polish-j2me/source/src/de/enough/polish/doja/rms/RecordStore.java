/**
 * A class representing a record store.
 * 
 * A class representing a record store. A record store consists of a
 * collection of records which will remain persistent across multiple
 * invocations of the MIDlet. The platform is responsible for
 * making its best effort to maintain the integrity of the
 * MIDlet's record stores throughout the normal use of the
 * platform, including reboots, battery changes, etc.
 * 
 * <p>Record stores are created in platform-dependent locations, which
 * are not exposed to the MIDlets. The naming space for record stores
 * is controlled at the MIDlet suite granularity. MIDlets within a
 * MIDlet suite are allowed to create multiple record stores, as long
 * as they are each given different names. When a MIDlet suite is
 * removed from a platform all the record stores associated with its
 * MIDlets will also be removed. MIDlets within a MIDlet suite can
 * access each other's record stores directly. New APIs in MIDP 2.0
 * allow for the explicit sharing of record stores if the MIDlet
 * creating the RecordStore chooses to give such permission.</p>
 * 
 * <p> Sharing is accomplished through the ability to name a
 * RecordStore created by another MIDlet suite.</p>
 * 
 * <P> RecordStores are uniquely named using the unique name of the
 * MIDlet suite plus the name of the RecordStore. MIDlet suites are
 * identified by the MIDlet-Vendor and MIDlet-Name attributes from the
 * application descriptor.</p>
 * 
 * <p> Access controls are defined when RecordStores to be shared are
 * created. Access controls are enforced when RecordStores are
 * opened. The access modes allow private use or shareable
 * with any other MIDlet suite.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Record store names are case sensitive and may consist of any
 * combination of between one and 32 Unicode characters
 * inclusive. Record store names must be unique within the scope of a
 * given MIDlet suite. In other words, MIDlets within a MIDlet suite
 * are not allowed to create more than one record store with the same
 * name, however a MIDlet in one MIDlet suite is allowed to have a
 * record store with the same name as a MIDlet in another MIDlet
 * suite. In that case, the record stores are still distinct and
 * separate.</p>
 * 
 * <p>No locking operations are provided in this API. Record store
 * implementations ensure that all individual record store operations
 * are atomic, synchronous, and serialized, so no corruption will
 * occur with multiple accesses. However, if a MIDlet uses multiple
 * threads to access a record store, it is the MIDlet's responsibility
 * to coordinate this access or unintended consequences may result.
 * Similarly, if a platform performs transparent synchronization of a
 * record store, it is the platform's responsibility to enforce
 * exclusive access to the record store between the MIDlet and
 * synchronization engine.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Records are uniquely identified within a given record store by
 * their recordId, which is an integer value. This recordId is used as
 * the primary key for the records. The first record created in a
 * record store will have recordId equal to one (1). Each subsequent
 * record added to a RecordStore will be assigned a recordId one
 * greater than the record added before it. That is, if two records
 * are added to a record store, and the first has a recordId of 'n',
 * the next will have a recordId of 'n + 1'. MIDlets can create other
 * sequences of the records in the RecordStore by using the
 * <code>RecordEnumeration</code> class.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This record store uses long integers for time/date stamps, in
 * the format used by System.currentTimeMillis(). The record store is
 * time stamped with the last time it was modified. The record store
 * also maintains a <em>version</em> number, which is an integer that
 * is incremented for each operation that modifies the contents of the
 * RecordStore.  These are useful for synchronization engines as well
 * as other things.</p>

	 * @param comparator - if non-null, will be used to determine the order in which the records are returned
	 * @param keepUpdated - if true, the enumerator will keep its enumeration current with any changes in the records of the record store. Use with caution as there are possible performance consequences. If false the enumeration will not be kept current and may return recordIds for records that have been deleted or miss records that are added later. It may also return records out of order that have been modified after the enumeration was built. Note that any changes to records in the record store are accurately reflected when the record is later retrieved, either directly or through the enumeration. The thing that is risked by setting this parameter false is the filtering and sorting order of the enumeration when records are modified, added, or deleted.
