/**
 * A class representing a record store. A class representing a record store. A
 * record store consists of a collection of records which will remain persistent
 * across multiple invocations of the MIDlet. The platform is responsible for
 * making its best effort to maintain the integrity of the MIDlet's record
 * stores throughout the normal use of the platform, including reboots, battery
 * changes, etc.
 * <p>
 * Record stores are created in platform-dependent locations, which are not
 * exposed to the MIDlets. The naming space for record stores is controlled at
 * the MIDlet suite granularity. MIDlets within a MIDlet suite are allowed to
 * create multiple record stores, as long as they are each given different
 * names. When a MIDlet suite is removed from a platform all the record stores
 * associated with its MIDlets will also be removed. MIDlets within a MIDlet
 * suite can access each other's record stores directly. New APIs in MIDP 2.0
 * allow for the explicit sharing of record stores if the MIDlet creating the
 * RecordStore chooses to give such permission.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Sharing is accomplished through the ability to name a RecordStore created by
 * another MIDlet suite.
 * </p>
 * <P>
 * RecordStores are uniquely named using the unique name of the MIDlet suite
 * plus the name of the RecordStore. MIDlet suites are identified by the
 * MIDlet-Vendor and MIDlet-Name attributes from the application descriptor.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Access controls are defined when RecordStores to be shared are created.
 * Access controls are enforced when RecordStores are opened. The access modes
 * allow private use or shareable with any other MIDlet suite.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Record store names are case sensitive and may consist of any combination of
 * between one and 32 Unicode characters inclusive. Record store names must be
 * unique within the scope of a given MIDlet suite. In other words, MIDlets
 * within a MIDlet suite are not allowed to create more than one record store
 * with the same name, however a MIDlet in one MIDlet suite is allowed to have a
 * record store with the same name as a MIDlet in another MIDlet suite. In that
 * case, the record stores are still distinct and separate.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * No locking operations are provided in this API. Record store implementations
 * ensure that all individual record store operations are atomic, synchronous,
 * and serialized, so no corruption will occur with multiple accesses. However,
 * if a MIDlet uses multiple threads to access a record store, it is the
 * MIDlet's responsibility to coordinate this access or unintended consequences
 * may result. Similarly, if a platform performs transparent synchronization of
 * a record store, it is the platform's responsibility to enforce exclusive
 * access to the record store between the MIDlet and synchronization engine.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Records are uniquely identified within a given record store by their
 * recordId, which is an integer value. This recordId is used as the primary key
 * for the records. The first record created in a record store will have
 * recordId equal to one (1). Each subsequent record added to a RecordStore will
 * be assigned a recordId one greater than the record added before it. That is,
 * if two records are added to a record store, and the first has a recordId of
 * 'n', the next will have a recordId of 'n + 1'. MIDlets can create other
 * sequences of the records in the RecordStore by using the
 * <code>RecordEnumeration</code> class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This record store uses long integers for time/date stamps, in the format used
 * by System.currentTimeMillis(). The record store is time stamped with the last
 * time it was modified. The record store also maintains a <em>version</em>
 * number, which is an integer that is incremented for each operation that
 * modifies the contents of the RecordStore. These are useful for
 * synchronization engines as well as other things.
 * </p>
