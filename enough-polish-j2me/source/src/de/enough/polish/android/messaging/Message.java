/**
 * This is the base interface for derived interfaces
 * that represent various types of messages. This package is
 * designed to work with <code>Message</code> objects that
 * may contain different elements depending on the underlying
 * messaging protocol. This is different from <code>Datagram</code>s that
 * are assumed always to be just blocks of binary data.
 * An adapter specification for a given messaging protocol
 * may define further interfaces derived from the <code>Message</code>
 * interfaces included in this generic specification.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The wireless messaging protocols that are accessed
 * via this API are typically of store-and-forward nature,
 * unlike network layer datagrams. Thus, the messages will
 * usually reach the recipient, even if the recipient is not
 * connected at the time of sending the message. This may
 * happen significantly later if the recipient is
 * disconnected for a long time. Sending, and possibly also
 * receiving, these wireless messages typically involves
 * a financial cost to the end user that cannot be neglected. Therefore,
 * applications should not send many messages unnecessarily.
 * </p>
 * <p>This interface contains the functionality common
 * to all messages. Concrete object instances representing
 * a message will typically implement other (sub)interfaces
 * providing access to the content and other information in
 * the message which is dependent on the type of the message.
 * </p>
 * <p>Object instances implementing this interface are just
 * containers for the data that is passed in. The <code>setAddress()</code>
 * method just sets the value of the address in the
 * data container without any checking whether the value
 * is valid in any way.
 * </p>
