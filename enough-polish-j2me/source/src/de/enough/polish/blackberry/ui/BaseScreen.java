     * must paint <em>every</em> pixel within this region. This is necessary
     * because the implementation is not required to clear the region prior to
     * calling <code>paint()</code> on it.  Thus, failing to paint
     * every pixel may result
     * in a portion of the previous screen image remaining visible. </p>
     * 
     * <p>Applications <em>must not</em> assume that
     * they know the underlying source of the <code>paint()</code>
     * call and use this
     * assumption
     * to paint only a subset of the pixels within the clip region. The
     * reason is
     * that this particular <code>paint()</code> call may have
     * resulted from multiple
     * <code>repaint()</code>
     * requests, some of which may have been generated from outside the
     * application. An application that paints only what it thinks is
     * necessary to
     * be painted may display incorrectly if the screen contents had been
     * invalidated by, for example, an incoming telephone call. </p>
     * 
     * <p>Operations on this graphics object after the <code>paint()
     * </code>call returns are
     * undefined. Thus, the application <em>must not</em> cache this
     * <code>Graphics</code>
     * object for later use or use by another thread. It must only be
     * used within
     * the scope of this method. </p>
     * 
     * <p>The implementation may postpone visible effects of
     * graphics operations until the end of the paint method.</p>
     * 
     * <p> The contents of the <code>Canvas</code> are never saved if
     * it is hidden and then
     * is made visible again. Thus, shortly after
     * <code>showNotify()</code> is called,
     * <code>paint()</code> will always be called with a
     * <code>Graphics</code> object whose clip region
     * specifies the entire displayable area of the
     * <code>Canvas</code>.  Applications
     * <em>must not</em> rely on any contents being preserved from a previous
     * occasion when the <code>Canvas</code> was current. This call to
     * <code>paint()</code> will not
     * necessarily occur before any other key or pointer
     * methods are called on the <code>Canvas</code>.  Applications
     * whose repaint
     * recomputation is expensive may create an offscreen
     * <code>Image</code>, paint into it,
     * and then draw this image on the <code>Canvas</code> when
     * <code>paint()</code> is called. </p>
     * 
     * <P>The application code must never call <code>paint()</code>;
     * it is called only by
     * the implementation.</P>
     * 
     * <P>The <code>Graphics</code> object passed to the
     * <code>paint()</code> method has the following
     * properties:</P>
     * <UL>
     * <LI>the destination is the actual display, or if double buffering is in
     * effect, a back buffer for the display;</LI>
     * <LI>the clip region includes at least one pixel
     * within this <code>Canvas</code>;</LI>
     * <LI>the current color is black;</LI>
     * <LI>the font is the same as the font returned by
     * <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Font.html#getDefaultFont()"><CODE>Font.getDefaultFont()</CODE></A>;</LI>

     * <LI>the origin of the coordinate system is located at the upper-left
     * corner of the <code>Canvas</code>; and</LI>

     * been changed.  This
     * method has augmented semantics compared to <A HREF="../../../javax/microedition/lcdui/Displayable.html#sizeChanged(int, int)"><CODE>Displayable.sizeChanged</CODE></A>.
     * 
     * <p>In addition to the causes listed in
     * <code>Displayable.sizeChanged</code>, a size change can occur on a
     * <code>Canvas</code> because of a change between normal and
     * full-screen modes.</p>
     * 
     * <p>If the size of a <code>Canvas</code> changes while it is
     * actually visible on the
     * display, it may trigger an automatic repaint request.  If this occurs,
     * the call to <code>sizeChanged</code> will occur prior to the call to
     * <code>paint</code>.  If the <code>Canvas</code> has become smaller, the
     * implementation may choose not to trigger a repaint request if the
     * remaining contents of the <code>Canvas</code> have been
     * preserved.  Similarly, if
     * the <code>Canvas</code> has become larger, the implementation
     * may choose to trigger
     * a repaint only for the new region.  In both cases, the preserved
     * contents must remain stationary with respect to the origin of the
     * <code>Canvas</code>.  If the size change is significant to the
     * contents of the
     * <code>Canvas</code>, the application must explicitly issue a
     * repaint request for the
     * changed areas.  Note that the application's repaint request should not
     * cause multiple repaints, since it can be coalesced with repaint
     * requests that are already pending.</p>
     * 
     * <p>If the size of a <code>Canvas</code> changes while it is not
     * visible, the
     * implementation may choose to delay calls to <code>sizeChanged</code>
     * until immediately prior to the call to <code>showNotify</code>.  In
     * that case, there will be only one call to <code>sizeChanged</code>,
     * regardless of the number of size changes.</p>
     * 
     * <p>An application that is sensitive to size changes can update instance
     * variables in its implementation of <code>sizeChanged</code>.  These
     * updated values will be available to the code in the
     * <code>showNotify</code>, <code>hideNotify</code>, and
     * <code>paint</code> methods.</p>
