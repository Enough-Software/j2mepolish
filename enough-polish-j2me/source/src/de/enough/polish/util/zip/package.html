<p>Provides classes for compressing and uncompressing data.</p>
<p>The compression method used is the deflate algorithm as described in RFC 1951. It
runs a LZ77 algorithm (search for repeating sequences) followed by a huffmann 
encoding over the data Stream. It is also possible to a Gzip header in front
of the Stream. These headers do not increase the alorithms performance or the 
compression ratio, but add some more bytes to make the output compatible to the
GZIP standard  (as described in RFC 1952).
</p>
<p>
It might be usefull to know that the GZipInputStream, that is able to read from Deflate/Gzip
Streams, needs 32kB of memory due to the compression specifications. So it is highly 
recommended to use just one GZipStream at the time. The GZipOutputStream needs even more memory
so be especially careful in this case. However, when using the GZipOutputStream you can influance its
behaviour by several parameters that specify the window sizes for LZ77 and the huffman encoding.
</p>
<b>Compression parameters:</b>
<p>compressionType: Specify if you prefer extra GZip headers as descibed above.</p>
<p>plainWindowSize: This stands for the size of the lookupWindow used for the LZ77 algorithm. 
The maximum is 32767 and the minimum is 100 if you want to take advantage of this algorithm. The LZ77
will be switched off if you specify a lower value. This will of course lead to a faster compression
and a lower compression. Do not hesitate to use small values when dealing with small chunks of data, 
since large empty lookup windows are not usefull at all.
</p>

<p>huffmanWindowSize: Huffman encoding is based on the fact that short bitsequences are assigned to
frequent characters and the other way around. In order to do that the algorithm has to set gather 
frequency information <i>before</i> it is able to write the data to the OutputStream. All the data 
therefore has to be temporarily stored in a window specified by the parameter huffmanWindowSize. 
The maximum is 32767 and the minimum is 1024 (which is even pretty small). However it might be better
to switch this mode off if you deal with equally distributed characters/data (Set huffmanWindowSize
to 0). This will result in the use of a predefinded huffman encoding tree that does not need to be
saved in the hader (saves some bytes also).
</p>

<b>Last Hints:</b>
<p>
During compression of small data amounts (with several algorithms and their implementations) it might
happen that the encoded data is larger than the decoded original, since the data was of high entropy 
and could not be compressed well and there was a header added on top of this. So add your own checks
if you encouter this problem.
</p>
<p>That is it.<br> Well, you will not switch both modes off, will you? In this case you will just
obtain a poor CRC32 implementation. If you need just the veryfication use the CRC checksum methods directly.
