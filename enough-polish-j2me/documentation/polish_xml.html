	<p>
	The <code>polish.xml</code> file describes the project and is used to define
	all relevant properties and variables.
	</p>
	<p>Following tags are used:
	<table>
		<tr><th>Tag</th><th>Attributes</th><th>description</th></tr>
		<tr>
			<td>imageLoadStrategy</td>
			<td>background</td>
			<td>Determines whether images of Widgets, Backgrounds and Canvasses should
				be loaded in the background or in the foreground thread. The background-attribute
				should be either set to "yes" or "no".
				<br/>
				When images are loaded in the background the responsiveness of an application can
				improve dramatically, but it also means that
				some images are set while the user is in a screen.
				<br/>
				When images are loaded in the foreground, all images will be shown when the user
				is entering a screen. The responsiveness of the application might suffer, but the screens
				will not change without the user's input.
				<br/>
				Example:
				<br/>
				<code>
				&lt;imageLoadStrategy background="yes" /&gt;
				</code>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
