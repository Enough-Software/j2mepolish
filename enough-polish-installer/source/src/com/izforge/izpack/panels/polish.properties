# Properties which can be set. The property can have a friendly name ending with a semicolon. 
# Possible paths are separated by colons.
# Values are either absolute, can start from the OS agnostic root ("/" or "C:\") or from ${applications.home} like "C:\Program Files" on Windows.
# When a value ends with a star, all matches are added to the resulting combo box, in which the alphabetically last one will
# be shown as the first option. 
# The numbers before the properties are used for sorting.
